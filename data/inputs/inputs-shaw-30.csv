"Share blog: compressing LLMs.

Snippet: While the immense scale of LLMs is responsible for their impressive performance across a wide range of use cases, this presents challenges in their application to real-world problems. In this article, I discuss how we can overcome these challenges by compressing LLMs. I start with a high-level overview of key concepts and then walk through a concrete example with Python code."

"Share blog: Local LLM fine-tuning on Mac

Context:
This article is part of a larger series on using large language models (LLMs) in practice. In a previous post, I showed how to fine-tune an LLM using a single (free) GPU on Google Colab. While that example (and many others) readily runs on Nvidia hardware, they are not easily adapted to M-series Macs. In this article, I walk through an easy way to fine-tune an LLM locally on a Mac."

"Share blog: fine-tuning FLUX.1 on my face!

Context:
Although large language models (LLMs) seem to get all the attention these days, image-generation models have been advancing just as rapidly. The current state-of-the-art is FLUX.1, an image model from Black Forest Labs (a faction from the Stable Diffusion team). In this article, I share the full process I used for fine-tuning this model to generate unlimited high-quality photos of myself."
