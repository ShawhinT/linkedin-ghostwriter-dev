Landing a job isn’t the only way to make money with AI.

Here’s how you can turn your AI skills into income—no matter your background:

1. **Get a job:** Land a full-time role as a machine learning engineer, data scientist, or prompt engineer. The fastest way to steady income and learning.
2. **Implementation:** Help teams build and deploy real AI solutions as a freelancer or contractor. Solve specific technical problems for businesses.
3. **Strategy & Consulting:** Guide founders, managers, or non-technical teams on what’s possible (and what’s hype), helping them make smarter decisions.
4. **Education:** Teach others—run workshops, create courses, write tutorials, or build a YouTube channel. There’s a hungry audience eager to learn.

"AI principles I know at 29, I wish I had known at 24.","**Step 1: Purpose & Target Audience**  
- Purpose: Education + reflection (sharing hard-earned lessons about AI for younger/earlier learners, positioning Shaw as both approachable and experienced)  
- Target Audience: Early-career AI learners, junior professionals, ambitious students (people who wish they’d “started sooner”), possibly some founders and solopreneurs

**Step 2: Post Wireframe**  
- Hook: Allude to “things I wish I knew” (connects to age, experience, and value of hindsight)  
- Meat: List a handful of actionable AI principles/concepts that are both specific and helpful. Short explanations for each, but not overly long—add context/personal note where appropriate.  
- CTA: Invite the audience to share what they wish they learned earlier.

**Step 3: The Meat (Body) of the Post**

Here are 5 AI principles I wish someone had sat me down and explained when I was just getting started:

1. **Learn by building, not just reading.**  
   The fastest way to learn any AI concept is to put it in code—even if it’s messy and fails at first.

2. **Focus on fundamentals.**  
   The latest paper is exciting, but understanding core concepts (like loss functions, embeddings, inference) pays compounding interest.

3. **Evaluation matters more than you think.**  
   Building a working model is 10% of the battle. Measuring and improving it—especially with the right tests—makes you valuable.

4. **Real-world projects beat perfect portfolios.**  
   A shipped tool that helps a single user will open more doors than ten “toy” projects with no users.

5. **Nobody “knows it all”—embrace the gray area.**  
   Every top AI engineer I’ve met is still learning, asking questions, making mistakes. It’s not about knowing everything. It’s about staying curious.

**Step 4: CTA / Question**  
What’s one thing you wish you’d learned earlier in your AI journey?

**Step 5: Hook (Brainstorm Directions & Choose Best One)**

*Step 5A: Brainstorm angles:*
- [Reflective/Personal Story] “If I could talk to my 24-year-old self…”
- [Results/Outcomes] “29 vs. 24: What I actually learned that made a difference in AI”
- [Problem/Solution] “Most people waste years on the wrong things in AI—here’s what I wish I knew earlier”
- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “Why most newbies get stuck—and what I’d do differently”
- [List/Numbers] “5 principles I wish I knew before diving deep into AI”

*Step 5B: Notes for each:*
- [Reflective] – “What would I tell my younger self if I could start again?”
- [Results] – “The principles that actually moved the needle.”
- [Problem/Solution] – “I followed shiny trends instead of learning the hard stuff.”
- [Beginner-to-expert] – “You don’t have to know it all—you have to build and learn.”
- [List] – “Condense the big learnings for scannability”

*Step 5C: Choose strongest direction—Reflective/Personal Story + List for scannability*

**Final Hook:**  
If I could give my 24-year-old self a crash course in AI, here’s what I’d say.

**Step 6: Review for Style, Sequence, and Voice**  
- Personal, not preachy  
- Short, actionable, and open  
- Humble and invites audience to chime in

What’s one thing you wish you’d learned earlier in your AI journey?"
"Most top AI engineers aren’t more intelligent than you.
They just do this one thing more… BUILD","Step 1: Purpose & Audience  
- Purpose: Encourage and empower aspiring AI engineers/learners by demystifying “top AI engineers”. Validate the idea that action and building matter more than innate intelligence. Motivate action.  
- Audience: Aspiring AI engineers, AI learners, technical peers who may feel intimidated by perceived “genius” in the field.

Step 2: Wireframe  
Hook: Dispel the myth that “top AI engineers” are just more intelligent.  
Meat: Explain what actually separates the top performers (building, consistent action). Concrete, motivating language. Possible micro-example.  
CTA: Encourage readers to start building, or ask about their blockers. Only one CTA.

Step 3: Write the Meat  
The myth: “Top AI engineers must be born brilliant.”  
The truth: Consistent builders win.  
The most impressive engineers I know aren’t necessarily the smartest people in the room—they just *build more than everyone else*.  
Projects, prototypes, experiments.  
It’s less about IQ, more about showing up and getting your hands dirty, over and over.  
The real “secret” is out-executing, not out-thinking. Every week, something shipped—no matter how small.  
If you want to get ahead in AI, don’t wait to feel ready or smart enough.  
Start building, learn by doing, and you’ll be surprised how quickly you catch up.

Step 4: CTA  
What’s stopping you from starting your next project?

Step 5: Hook  
5A: Brainstorm labeled directions:  
- [Problem/solution]: “Think you need to be a genius to be a top AI engineer? You don’t.”  
- [Personal story]: “When I started out, I thought the smartest people would win—but I was wrong.”  
- [Results/outcomes]: “Every great AI engineer I know ships *something* every week—here’s why that matters.”  
- [Beginner-to-expert clarity]: “Most people overestimate intelligence and underestimate action in AI.”  
- [Myth-busting]: “Top AI engineers aren’t smarter than you—they’re just building more.”

5B: Add short notes  
- [Problem/solution]: Bust the genius myth, replace with actionable behavior  
- [Personal story]: Share own intimidation, what helped  
- [Results/outcomes]: Repetition, projects, compounding growth  
- [Beginner-to-expert clarity]: Clarity for those feeling “not smart enough”  
- [Myth-busting]: Direct language, accessible

5C: Choose one  
“Myth-busting” is the strongest and boldest direction and most direct for LinkedIn.

Step 6: Review for style, sequence, and voice  
- Direct, speaks to learners  
- Sequence is logical: myth → truth → action → invitation  
- No jargon, simple language  
- Only *one* CTA

7 LLM use cases (have helped me avoid hiring people as a solopreneur),"Step 1: Purpose & Audience  
- Purpose: Educate and validate content (share practical, real-world AI use cases tied to Shaw's personal experience as a solopreneur; demystify LLM value through examples).  
- Audience: Solopreneurs, indie founders, freelancers, and content creators looking to do more with less.

---

Step 2: Post Wireframe  

```
[Hook: Problem/solution or result—saving money/time with LLMs as a solopreneur]

[7 concrete LLM use case examples with brief explanations (how each replaced the need to hire someone); include lessons and what surprised me.]

[Focused CTA: What's one task you'd want to automate with AI right now?]
```

---

Step 3: Body (“Meat”)  

As a solo entrepreneur, time is always short—and hiring help isn't always realistic.

Here are 7 ways I’ve used large language models (LLMs) to fill gaps that used to require hiring:

1. **Writing + Editing:** Drafting emails, landing pages, and marketing copy—then having the LLM edit for clarity, tone, and grammar. Feels like an on-demand copyeditor.
2. **Market Research:** Summarizing Reddit threads, Quora answers, and tech blogs into actionable insights for new products or content ideas.
3. **Customer Support:** Drafting answers to repetitive email questions, speeding up response time while keeping things personal.
4. **Coding Assistant:** Troubleshooting scripts, auto-generating comments, and even translating code between languages—like having a junior dev on call.
5. **Content Brainstorming:** Spitballing YouTube titles, blog outlines, and even social post ideas—helps me break through creative blocks.
6. **Transcription & Summarization:** Turning meetings or voice notes into clean notes and summaries (honestly, I don’t think I could keep up without this).
7. **Data Cleanup:** Reformatting ugly spreadsheets, tagging messy data, and extracting key points—no more “can you just fix this CSV?” contractor work.

What surprised me most? **Small tasks add up.** By delegating them to an LLM, I saved dozens of hours (and thousands of dollars) so I can focus on building, not busywork.

---

Step 4: CTA/Question

What’s one task you wish you could automate with LLMs in your workflow?

---

Step 5: Hook

**Step 5A: Brainstorm 3–5 directions**

1. [Problem/Solution] Most solopreneurs feel the pressure to hire help. What if you could skip that step?
2. [Personal Result] How LLMs have saved me thousands—without hiring a single employee.
3. [Actionable List] 7 real-world LLM uses that replaced hiring (and saved my sanity).
4. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] Everyone talks LLMs, but here’s what they actually do for solo operators.
5. [Trend/Urgency] In 2024, LLMs are the “first hire” for solo founders—here are my top use cases.

**Step 5B: Add short notes**
1. “Pressure to delegate, but no budget? Here’s my workaround.”
2. “I ran the numbers—here’s how I let AI do the boring stuff.”
3. “Specific, battle-tested tips (actual tasks, not just buzzwords).”
4. “Move from hype to real, practical wins.”
5. “If you’re starting a business now, LLMs = your new team.”

**Step 5C: Choose strongest direction and write hook.**
#3 and #2 are strongest—personal + specific, action-focused.

Final hook:
I've saved thousands as a solopreneur by using LLMs as my virtual team.  
Here are 7 real tasks I no longer need to hire out—

---

Step 6: Review for voice, style, sequence  
- Tone is expert peer, “here’s what worked for me.”  
- Clear, skimmable list with real-world tasks.  
- Honest reflection, action-oriented, focused CTA.

By the end of this post you’ll be able to build your first AI agent,"Step 1: Purpose & Audience  
- Purpose: Educate and empower readers to take the first actionable step in building their own AI agent (likely as a free value/share post)  
- Audience: Beginners and aspiring builders in AI—entrepreneurs, developers, and curious techies in Shaw’s circle who haven’t yet built their first agent

Step 2: Wireframe  
- Hook: “By the end of this post you’ll be able to build your first AI agent”
- Meat:  
    - Short, step-by-step breakdown of what an AI agent is  
    - Why you don’t need to be an expert to start  
    - Actionable 3–5 step guide (simple, clear)
    - What you’ll accomplish (maybe a simple example: “email drafting agent in 15 minutes”)
    - Encouragement, transparency on what to expect
- CTA: “What would you build with your first AI agent?”

---

Step 3: Write the body (“meat”) of the post

Let’s break this down as simply as Shaw would:

---

AI agents sound intimidating. In reality, your first agent can be:
- A script that answers emails for you
- A bot that summarizes news headlines
- A simple tool that helps automate your calendar

You don’t need a PhD—or even be a full-time coder—to start.

Here’s the exact playbook I give to my students for their first AI agent:

1. **Pick a micro-problem**  
What’s a small, repeatable task you want to automate right now? (Think: summarize text, draft an email, pull info from a webpage.)

2. **Choose a no-code tool or platform**  
Try:
- [AgentGPT](https://agentgpt.reworkd.ai/) for agent creation in-browser
- [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) with OpenAI plugins for quick automation

3. **Describe your task clearly**  
Give the agent a simple, specific prompt: “Summarize important points from this article using 3 bullet points.”

4. **Test and improve**  
Run the agent. Review its output. Adjust the prompt until it’s useful.

That’s it. You’ve built your first AI agent.

The hardest part is starting. Most people overthink it—so don’t.

1. [Promise/Outcome] “By the end of this post you’ll be able to build your first AI agent”
2. [Problem/relief] “AI agents are simpler (and less scary) than you think”
3. [Personal story/failure] “My first AI agent was embarrassingly simple. Yours should be too.”
4. [Beginner’s confidence] “You don’t need to be a coder to launch your first AI agent this afternoon”
5. [Step-by-step clarity] “The exact 4-step workflow my students use to build their first agent”

Step 5B: Add notes to each direction

1. [Promise/Outcome] Focuses on empowering; “you’ll build this today”
2. [Problem/relief] Teases how people over-complicate; lowers barrier
3. [Personal story] Vulnerable, opens with failure or low bar
4. [Beginner’s confidence] Invites non-coders; practical optimism
5. [Step-by-step clarity] Highlights actionable structure

Step 5C: Choose and write the final hook

I like #1 for its directness but also #2 for lowering intimidation. Here’s a riff blending both:

“AI agents aren’t just for experts. Here’s how you can build your first agent right now (no coding required).”

**Step 3: Body of Post**

I started with no audience, no product, and a lot of trial and error. Here are the biggest lessons that helped me go from zero to $70K:

1. **Validate Before You Build:**  
   My first few ideas flopped because I built things I thought were cool instead of things people actually wanted. Everything changed when I started talking to potential users and selling the outcome—not the features.

2. **Document the Journey:**  
   Sharing small wins, failures, and learnings—*in real-time*—built trust. People want to see process, not just polished results.

3. **Simple Offers Win:**  
   Complicated products confused people. My first $10K came from offering a single 1:1 call and a simple AI project breakdown. One offer, clear value.

4. **Prioritize Relationships:**  
   Every big break came from someone in my network. I focused on helping, collaborating, and showing up consistently.

5. **Stay Consistent (Even When It Feels Pointless):**  
   Most traction showed up weeks *after* I felt like giving up. The compound effect is real, but it’s invisible for a while.

These aren’t tactics—they’re mindsets and habits I wish I’d started with.

- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “Everyone asks about my $70K journey—here’s a transparent breakdown (the real story).”

**Notes on Each:**
- Problem/solution: Calls out the silent struggle with early income.
- Personal story: Shares vulnerability—speaks to those on the edge of quitting.
- Results: Direct, quantitative—sets expectation for concrete lessons.
- Trend/urgency: Ties to current climate, urgency.
- Beginner-to-expert: “The real story” implies transparency, combats hype.

**Pick strongest:** ""From $0 to $70,000: 5 lessons I wish I knew sooner.""  
(Direct, numbers in the hook, sets up a practical and honest list.)

5 AI projects you can actually build in under an hour (even if you’re not a coder)

Most people think building with AI needs weeks of learning, complex setups, or “real” coding chops.

Here’s the truth: You can build something real—today.

Here are 5 projects you can finish in less than an hour:

1. **AI Blog Post Generator**  
   Type in a headline, get a first draft in seconds. Use GPT-4 (or Claude) with a no-code tool like Zapier for end-to-end automation. Fast way to level up your prompt skills.

2. **Chatbot for Your Portfolio**  
   Embed a chatbot on your website that answers questions about your work, services, or skills. It’s a conversation starter—and a huge portfolio upgrade.

3. **YouTube Video Summarizer**  
   Paste a video link, get instant key takeaways. Use OpenAI’s API or Python with Whisper to transcribe + summarize—saves time and levels up your API chops.

4. **Personal Recipe Recommender**  
   Input what’s in your fridge, get meal ideas tailored to you. Try with Zapier or Make.com plus a language model—or hack up a script in Python.

5. **Email Classifier**  
   Automate labeling and prioritizing your inbox using an LLM. Set it up in Gmail with Apps Script or a workflow tool. Learn real “human-in-the-loop” AI.

50k subs YouTube milestone,"**Step 1: Purpose & Audience**  
- **Purpose:** Celebrate milestone, build credibility, humanize Shaw, invite community engagement, and validate continued content focus 
- **Audience:** YouTube subscribers, broader LinkedIn network (builders, AI enthusiasts, creators), prospective students/followers

**Step 2: Post Wireframe**  
- Hook: Milestone + honest reflection    
- Body: Journey to 50k subs, what’s worked, what’s surprised you, gratitude, lessons learned so far  
- CTA: Invite followers to share what content helped them most (validation/engagement)  

**Step 3: Body (“Meat” of the post)**
---
Hitting 50,000 subscribers on YouTube wasn’t something I expected when I posted my first walkthrough of an AI project.

A few honest observations from the journey so far:
- The videos that took the longest to make rarely performed the best (lesson: ship, then iterate)
- My DMs are full of thoughtful questions from viewers—many of you are building things I hadn’t even imagined
- Showing “behind the scenes” (the ugly code, the failed agent runs) gets the most engagement—and the best conversations

What’s worked: Consistency over hype, showing my real thought process, and answering the actual questions people have (not just what’s trending).

Grateful for this community of builders, learners, and curious minds. Every comment and subscribe is a nudge to keep going.

**Step 4: CTA**
---
What’s been the most helpful video or topic for your own projects?

**Step 5A: Brainstorm Hook Directions**
1. [Milestone/Surprise]: “50k subscribers—never thought I’d be here.”
2. [Personal Story]: “I filmed my first video with zero expectations.”
3. [Thank You/Community]: “This community changed my career.”
4. [Problem/Solution]: “Most creators overthink setup—here’s what actually matters.”
5. [Beginner-to-Expert]: “What 50,000 subscribers taught me about teaching AI.”

**Step 5B: Notes**
1. [Milestone/Surprise]: Play up honest surprise/appreciation.
2. [Personal Story]: Reference the humble beginnings/first upload.
3. [Thank You/Community]: Emphasize comments, DMs, engagement.
4. [Problem/Solution]: Could work but less relevant for milestone.
5. [Beginner-to-Expert]: Good for a “hard-won lessons” angle.

**Step 5C: Choose Hook Direction & Write Hook**
Go with a blend of [Milestone/Surprise] and [Personal Story] for authenticity.

Final hook:
I hit 50,000 YouTube subscribers—and honestly, I never thought I’d get past the first 100.

**Step 6: Review for Style & Voice**
- It’s direct, grounded, and appreciation-driven.
- Reflection and honest observations, not just hype.
- Highlights community and mistakes.
- Clear single CTA.

**Step 7: Assemble Final Post**

"Reminder: being rich isn’t about what’s in you bank account, but what’s in your mind… keep learning","Step 1: Post Purpose & Target Audience  
- Purpose: Inspire and encourage ongoing learning (mindset/education angle), subtle personal brand reinforcement  
- Audience: Broad audience—potential students, fellow entrepreneurs, professionals interested in personal development and growth  

Step 2: Wireframe  
- Hook: “Being rich isn’t just about numbers in your bank account.”  
- Meat: Personal riff on wealth being mindset over money; possibly a brief story or “what I’ve learned”  
- CTA: Question about learning or investing in yourself  

Step 3: Body  
It took me years to realize that the real wealth isn’t in the balance you see on your banking app.  
It’s in your habits, your curiosity, and how quickly you can pick up new skills.  
Every time I invest in learning—whether it’s AI, a new tool, or just talking to someone smarter than me—I get a return that blows any stock out of the water.  
Money helps, sure. But what you *know* (and how you grow) actually compounds forever.  

Step 4: CTA  
What’s one skill you’re working on right now that you know will pay off in the future?  

Step 5: Hook Explorations  
5A: Labeled directions  
- [Problem/solution]: Chasing money vs. investing in knowledge  
- [Personal story]: Took me years to get that “wealth = mindset”  
- [Beginner-to-expert clarity]: Most think being rich is about money—but it’s about mental capital  
- [Results/outcomes]: Learning compounds faster than any investment  
5B: Notes  
- [Problem/solution]: “Bank account balance is visible, mindset wealth is hidden.”  
- [Personal story]: “Early on, I chased dollars—not breakthroughs.”  
- [Beginner/expert]: “Everyone talks about wealth—few talk about learning as the engine.”  
- [Results]: “Returns on learning > returns on index funds, long run.”  
5C: Choose strongest direction: Beginner-to-expert clarity (challenge misconception, use familiar phrase)  
Final Hook: “Being rich isn’t about what’s in your bank account—it’s about what’s in your mind.”  

Step 6: Review for style & voice  
- Direct, honest, “mentor/friend”  
- Encourages learning, connects growth to compounding  
- Plain language, practical reflection  
- Engaging, one focused question CTA  

Step 7: Final Post  

---
Being rich isn’t about what’s in your bank account—it’s about what’s in your mind.

It took me years to realize that real wealth isn’t measured by your bank balance.  
It’s built through your habits, curiosity, and ability to pick up new skills—fast.

Every time I invest in learning—whether it’s AI, a new tool, or a conversation with someone smarter than me—I get returns that put any investment portfolio to shame.

Money comes and goes. But what you *know* (and how you grow) compounds for a lifetime.

What’s one skill you’re working on right now that you know will pay off in the future?

Step 3: The Meat  

AI means a lot of things—let’s make it concrete with 3 real types of software:

1️⃣ **Automation tools**  
Think scheduling emails, data entry, or invoice processing. Often no “intelligence”—just rules and triggers. Example: Zapier.

2️⃣ **Traditional machine learning**  
These softwares spot patterns in numbers or text: fraud detection, spam filtering, sales forecasting. Example: A custom-trained model to predict customer churn.

3️⃣ **Generative AI (like ChatGPT)**  
This is what’s getting all the hype. Tools that can create language, images, or even music—think writing an email draft or generating code. Example: ChatGPT, Midjourney.

If you’re not sure what someone means by “AI,” ask what kind of software (and problem) they’re actually talking about. It changes everything!

Use examples
Use analogies","Let’s break this down using the process step-by-step as instructed.

---

### Step 1: Purpose + Audience

**Purpose:** Educate data scientists on how to communicate their work more clearly (technical communication skills).

**Audience:** Data scientists, data/AI professionals, technical solopreneurs trying to share their work with non-technical audiences (managers, clients, team members).

---

### Step 2: Post Wireframe

```

[Meat: 3 communication tips for data scientists, each explained: stories, examples, analogies—why they matter, quick how-to]

[CTA: Focused 1-line question to spark discussion/sharing]
```

---

### Step 3: Write Body First (The Meat)

Here’s the content, structured with short, actionable tips:

---

If your audience *doesn’t get it*, your work won’t matter—no matter how clever your code.

Here are 3 communication tricks every data scientist should steal from great teachers:

**1. Use stories**
Numbers are powerful, but stories are sticky. Wrap your findings in a quick narrative: “Last quarter, the marketing team was stuck. Here’s how a single model helped them cut ad costs by 40%.”

**2. Use concrete examples**  
Don’t just explain “classification” - show what it means: “Think of Gmail deciding which emails are spam.”

**3. Use analogies**
Translate complex concepts into everyday language. Instead of “gradient descent,” try: “It’s like finding the fastest path down a mountain in thick fog—step by step.”

These 3 tricks turn technical work into actionable insight people actually remember.

---

### Step 4: Write CTA/Question

Only ONE. Let’s focus it. Options:  
- What's your go-to communication trick?  
- Which of these do you use?  
- What's the hardest part about explaining your work?

Pick ONE: Let’s go with the most engagement-oriented:  
**What’s your go-to trick for making complex ideas stick?**

---

### Step 5: Brainstorm and Choose a Hook

**Step 5A: Label Hook Angles**
1. [Problem/solution]: Data scientists’ work is wasted if no one understands it.
2. [Beginner-expert clarity]: Most data scientists struggle with getting buy-in because they talk in technical jargon.
3. [Personal story]: How I lost my audience the first time I presented a model—and how I fixed it.
4. [Numbers/list]: 3 high-impact ways to make your technical work land.
5. [Urgency]: Ready to make your data science projects 10x more persuasive?

**Step 5B: Add Imagery/Notes**
1. ""You built something cool—nobody gets it.""
2. ""Technical, but nobody listening.""
3. ""Client’s eyes glazed over. Added a story—they got it immediately.""
4. ""3 tricks for data scientists who want people to understand their work""
5. ""Want real buy-in? Try these.""

**Step 5C: Select and Write Final Hook**

I’ll choose [Problem/solution] for clarity and relevance:
- You can build the perfect model—  
but if nobody understands it, it’s worthless.

---

### Step 6: Review for Voice, Sequence, Style

- Opens with a strong “problem” hook.
- 3 clear tips in friendly, confidence-boosting tone, with real examples/phrases.
- Ends with a single, highly focused question that encourages sharing.

**Step 3: Body/Meat of the Post**

If I had to learn AI from zero in 2025, here’s the path I’d take:

1. **Start with ChatGPT (or similar tools):**  
   Get hands-on immediately. Play, ask questions, break things, and see what AI can (and can’t) do.

2. **Install Python:**  
   Still the language of AI. Get comfortable with basic syntax, running scripts, and working with libraries like pandas or numpy.

3. **Build Your First Automation (Beginner):**  
   Use Python and AI APIs to automate a simple daily task—think: summarizing emails, renaming files, scraping data.

4. **Build a Basic Machine Learning Project (Intermediate):**  
   Try a classic ML problem—house price prediction, sentiment analysis, image sorting—using open-source tutorials.

If I had to learn AI from scratch in 2025, here’s exactly what I’d do (no jargon, no fluff).

1. Start with ChatGPT (or any LLM): 
   Play around. Get curious. Use it to answer questions, write code, or just explore what’s possible.

2. Install Python: 
   Still the backbone of AI. Get comfortable with basic syntax and running simple scripts.

3. Build your first automation (beginner):
   Use AI to automate something in your daily workflow—summarizing notes, renaming files, scraping simple data.

4. Tackle a real machine learning project (intermediate):
   Try a classic task like predicting housing prices or basic sentiment analysis using a public dataset.

5. Launch a real-world project (advanced):
   Solve a problem you care about. Doesn’t need to be pretty—just real and useful. Share your learnings online.

You don’t need a PhD or expensive course to make progress in AI. You need momentum, projects, and curiosity.

Which step do you want help with first?

[CTA: What would you want to break down next? OR What’s your biggest question about making your first $10k month? PICK ONE]
```

---

**Step 3: Body/Meat of the Post**

Let’s break down the actual numbers from my first $10k month as a solo entrepreneur 👇

- **AI Consulting:** $4,200  
  Mostly short-term projects for startups and SMBs looking to integrate GPT into customer support and internal workflows. These gigs came from LinkedIn DMs + one referral.
- **Online Course Sales:** $3,100  
  My main AI fundamentals course (pre-recorded, async) plus a live Zoom workshop. Most buyers found me through YouTube and LinkedIn content.
- **Freelance Dev Work:** $1,800  
  One-off projects—mostly building quick agent prototypes and internal automations for other solopreneurs.
- **Productized Notion/AI Templates:** $900  
  Sold digital downloads—simple, repeatable, and honestly one of the easiest parts to scale.

**What surprised me:**
- I thought consulting would take more time than course-building, but both demanded similar energy (just in completely different ways).
- Most course sales came right after sharing honest “build in public” updates, not from traditional marketing.
- The digital products made less, but were 99% passive after setup.

**If you’re on the same path:**
- Don’t chase “passive income” as your first goal—get some quick wins freelancing/consulting, then reinvest into products and content.
- Share your learning AND your numbers. People trust what they can see.

I just hit my first $10k month as a solo entrepreneur. Here’s the unfiltered breakdown—real numbers, no fluff 👇

Let’s break down exactly how I made $10,000 last month:

- **AI Consulting:** $4,200  
  Small projects for startups and SMBs, usually integrating GPT into support or automations. Most came via LinkedIn DMs and a referral.

- **Online Course Sales:** $3,100  
  My AI fundamentals course (pre-recorded and live workshop). Sales mostly came after sharing real “build in public” updates—not slick funnels.

- **Freelance Dev Work:** $1,800  
  Quick projects: agent prototypes and automation builds for other solopreneurs.

- **Productized Notion/AI Templates:** $900  
  Digital downloads. Easiest income stream to scale, and nearly passive once set up.

**A few surprises:**
- I expected consulting to take more time than courses, but both demanded similar energy in different ways.
- Course sales spiked when I posted honestly about my journey—not after ads or launches.
- Digital products earned less, but required almost no work after launch.

If you’re on this journey:  
Don’t chase “passive income” from day one. Start with freelance/consulting, reinvest wins into products and content, and share your numbers—the transparency builds trust.

What’s your biggest question about reaching your own $10k month?"
Managing technical debt when coding with AI. Being mindful of speed-debt tradeoff.,"Step 1:  
**Purpose:** Educate and share a practical mindset about managing technical debt when coding with AI.  
**Target audience:** Fellow technical entrepreneurs, indie hackers, and developers building with AI tools.

---

Step 2:  
**Wireframe:**  
- [Hook]  
- [Briefly explain technical debt in context of AI development]  
- [Personal lesson/observation about speed vs. long-term cost]  
- [Share practical ways to manage the tradeoff]  
- [CTA: Ask readers how they handle this]

---

Step 3:  
**Body of the post:**  

When you’re building with AI, shortcuts are tempting—especially with how fast everything moves.  
But every TODO left in a prompt, every “just ship it” workaround, adds a little to your technical debt.  
In the early days, speed is king. You want to learn, validate, and iterate. But if you keep ignoring the pileup, every change gets harder and harder.  
Here’s what’s worked for me:  
- Make debt explicit. I keep a living list of AI “hacks” I’ve used and their risks.  
- Schedule debt paydown days. Refactor prompts, clean up ragged workflows, revisit agents that grew messy.  
- Always ask: Am I trading a week’s gain for a month’s pain?

---

Step 4:  
**CTA or question:**  
How do you balance speed and technical debt in your AI projects?

---

Step 5A:  
**Brainstorming hook directions:**  

1. [Problem/solution] Most people underestimate the cost of “just one more hack” when coding with AI.
2. [Personal story] I’ve lost weeks cleaning up AI projects that started fast but grew out of control.
3. [Results/outcomes] Over time, every shortcut you take with AI becomes a roadblock to growth.
4. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] The #1 mistake I see in AI projects: ignoring technical debt for too long.
5. [Trend/urgency] In AI development, speed wins—until it doesn’t.

Step 5B:  
Notes:

1. “Just one more hack”—builds up quickly, stall progress.
2. Personal burn: fast launch leads to longer refactoring, regret.
3. Shortcuts accumulate; explaining compounding pain.
4. Beginners don’t see debt piling up; advice from painful experiences.
5. Emphasizes pace, then the eventual slowdown.

Step 5C:  
**Strongest direction:** #4 – actionable clarity from Shaw’s tech mentor voice.  
**Final hook:**  
The #1 AI coding mistake: ignoring technical debt until it bites you.

---

Step 6:  
**Review for style, sequence, and voice:**  
- Hook is direct, pain-focused, addresses the reader.

The #1 AI coding mistake: ignoring technical debt until it bites you.

When you’re building with AI, shortcuts are tempting—especially with how fast everything moves.

But every TODO left in a prompt, every “just ship it” workaround, adds a little to your technical debt.

In the early days, speed is king. You want to learn, validate, and iterate. But if you keep ignoring the pileup, every change gets harder and harder.

Here’s what’s worked for me:
- Make debt explicit. I keep a living list of AI “hacks” I’ve used and their risks.
- Schedule debt paydown days. Refactor prompts, clean up ragged workflows, revisit agents that grew messy.
- Always ask: Am I trading a week’s gain for a month’s pain?

How do you balance speed and technical debt in your AI projects?"

Step 3:  
**Body of Post:**  
Making LLMs “multimodal” basically means giving them the power to work with more than just text—think images, audio, video, code, and beyond.  
But how do you actually do this in practice? Here are 3 big approaches I break down in my latest blog:
  
1. **LLM + Tools:**  
    The LLM calls on outside APIs or plugins to process non-text data (e.g., image recognition tools). Simple to add—powerful when mixed right.

2. **LLM + Adapters:**  
    Plug specialized modules (“adapters”) into your LLM, translating images or sounds into tokens it understands. Better performance, more flexibility—but a bit more complex to wire up.

3. **Unified Models:**  
    Build a single model that natively accepts different kinds of inputs (OpenAI’s GPT-4o is a good example). Cutting-edge, but often more demanding to train and use right now.

Whether you’re an engineer or just LLM-curious, understanding these approaches is foundational for the next wave of AI apps.

Multimodal AI sounds futuristic—but there are 3 straightforward ways to make your LLMs work with more than text.

“Multimodal” just means your LLM can process images, audio, video, and more—not just raw text.  
Here are the 3 main strategies I break down (with examples) in my new blog:

1. **LLM + Tools:**  
    Have your LLM call image/video/audio APIs as needed. Simple, flexible.

2. **LLM + Adapters:**  
    Plug in “adapters” that turn non-text data into tokens your LLM digests. More engineering, but more control.

3. **Unified Models:**  
    Train one model that natively handles everything, like GPT-4o. (Cutting-edge, but requires serious resources.)

**Step 3: Post Body (Meat)**

This week, I took a pretty unusual step:
I fine-tuned FLUX.1 (an open-source diffusion model) on a dataset of... my own face.

Why?  
Because the best way to learn a tool is to break it, iterate, and see what surprises show up.

A few things that surprised me:
- You *don’t* need a massive dataset. I used just [xx] images, and the model learned my features in hours.
- The quirks and “failures” were sometimes the most interesting—like the model inventing new hats for me.

Full process, code snippets, and honest photos (good and weird) now on the blog.

---

Yes, I trained an AI model to generate my own face. Here’s what actually happened.

This week, I fine-tuned FLUX.1 (an open-source diffusion model) using a dataset of… well, my own headshots.

Why? Because hands-on experiments are the best way to learn (even if things get a little weird).

A few things I discovered:
• You don’t need thousands of images—I saw solid results with just [XX] shots and a few hours of training.
• The failures were sometimes better than the “wins.” (Turns out, the model really likes giving me new hairstyles).
• Getting under the hood demystifies the process—and gives you the confidence to try your own spin.

Journey post: Leaving my job and failing for 15 months. Finally hitting $10k in one month. ,"**Step 1: Purpose & Audience**

- **Purpose:** Inspire and validate other entrepreneurs/solopreneurs by sharing Shaw’s personal journey and milestone. Humanize the struggle behind “overnight” success; serve as behind-the-scenes transparency.
- **Audience:** Aspiring entrepreneurs, freelancers contemplating leaving their job, early-stage founders, AI/tech creators who follow Shaw.

---

**Step 2: Post Wireframe**

- Hook: Something that contrasts the “milestone” with the “struggle period”—either setting up the failure period or teasing the $10k month.
- Meat: Candid summary of leaving the job, struggling for 15 months, lessons learned (emphasis: not overnight), how it felt, what shifted, the path to finally hitting the $10K month.
- CTA: Direct question inviting others to share their own milestones or lessons from tough periods.

---

**Step 3: Body (“Meat”)**

15 months.

That’s how long I spent failing after quitting my day job—burning through savings, launching projects that flopped, doubting my skills almost every week.

I thought I was making all the “smart” moves:
- Learning new AI skills
- Building products nobody used
- Trying to freelance for anyone who’d respond on Upwork

But nothing clicked. Most months, I made less than my old weekly paycheck.

I kept going because I knew the alternative: staying somewhere safe, but never building on my own terms.

In month 16, things started to shift.
- Got laser-focused on a single audience (AI educators/solo founders)
- Said “no” to bad-fit projects
- Committed to sharing what I’d actually learned (failures included)

That’s when I landed consistent clients and—I still can’t believe this—finally cracked $10k in a single month.

Was it worth the struggle? Absolutely. But it was never overnight. And I still have a lot to figure out.

- [Personal story] “I almost quit—here’s what happened next.”
- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “Most people underestimate just how long the ‘grind’ phase lasts.”
- [Results/outcomes] “This isn't overnight success: My first $10k month took 476 days.”
- [Urgency/trend] “We celebrate wins, but nobody talks about the 15 months before.”

**5B: Notes per direction**
- Problem/solution: Emphasize the *duration* and *pain* before success.
- Personal story: “Almost gave up—major self-doubt—then breakthrough.”
- Beginner-to-expert: Calling out the “overnight success” myth.
- Results: Concrete time metric, gives the $ amount and days.
- Urgency: Contrast between what’s posted and what’s lived.

**5C: Choose strongest and write final hook.**

Chosen Hook Direction: Results/outcomes (since the concrete “476 days/$10k” makes a compelling, honest opener in Shaw’s voice).

**Final Hook:**  
It took me 476 days (and a lot of failure) to hit my first $10k month.

15 months. That’s how long I spent failing after quitting my day job—burning through savings, launching projects that flopped, doubting my skills almost every week.

I thought I was making all the “right” moves:
- Learning new AI skills
- Building products nobody used
- Trying to freelance for anyone who’d respond on Upwork

But nothing clicked. Most months, I made less than my old weekly paycheck.

I kept going because I knew the alternative: staying comfortable and never building something of my own.

In month 16, everything started to shift:
- Got laser-focused on a single audience (AI educators and solo founders)
- Learned to say no to bad-fit projects
- Started sharing what I’d learned—the failures included

That’s when clients actually came. That’s when I finally cracked a $10k month.

Birthday post. Past year recap by the numbers.,"**Step-by-Step Process:**

**Step 1: Purpose & Audience**
- **Purpose:** Share a personal milestone, reflect transparently (build trust, behind-the-scenes), and demonstrate growth/lessons.
- **Audience:** Shaw’s followers, especially those interested in AI, solopreneur journey, educators, fellow entrepreneurs, and future students.

**Step 2: Post Wireframe**
- [Hook: Tease milestone + curiosity about “the numbers”]
- [Meat: Share a short, transparent “this year in numbers” recap with quick insights. Mix real numbers, honest lows/highs, and 1–2 reflections.]
- [CTA: “What’s something you’re proud of from the past year?”]

**Step 3: Write the Body of the Post**
---
This past year as an AI educator and solopreneur, I tracked everything.  
Here’s the brutally honest recap:

- Launched 2 new AI courses (and scrapped one that totally flopped 😅)
- 9,700+ new students from 32 countries
- 34 LinkedIn posts (I promised weekly—missed 18 times)
- 4 new automations built (saved over 140 hours of grunt work)
- 2 product ideas that went nowhere, but led to my current newsletter
- $128k in revenue (all solo, no team)
- 5 major lessons learned (biggest: talk to users earlier, always!)

Did I hit every goal? Not even close.  
But looking back, that’s what actually drove the growth.

**Step 4: CTA**
What’s one number you’re proud of from your own past year—big or small?

**Step 5: Write the Hook (use explicit direction process)**

5A. Brainstorm labeled directions:
- [Personal milestone]: “It’s my birthday—here’s what the last year REALLY looked like.”
- [By the numbers]: “The past 12 months, by the numbers (raw and real).”
- [Reflection]: “Every year, I track my progress in numbers. Here’s what surprised me most.”
- [Vulnerability]: “Not every number is a win—but here’s my real report card.”
- [Growth]: “From zero to $128k: my solo year as an AI educator.”

5B. Add notes:
- [By the numbers]: Transparent, quick stats, both wins and misses.
- [Vulnerability]: Owning flops as much as wins. Honest tone.
- [Growth]: Teasing the revenue number, but tying it to being solo/independent.

5C. Choose the strongest and write the final hook:
The [By the numbers] angle best fits—combines transparency, curiosity, and aligns with Shaw's brand.

**Final Hook:**  
My past year as an AI solopreneur—by the numbers (raw & unfiltered):

**Step 6: Review for Style, Sequence, and Voice**
Tone: Humble, honest, personal.  
Sequence: Hook → Data/recap (bullets, specific) → Reflection → Clean, single CTA.  
Voice: Approachable, peer-to-peer.

My past year as an AI solopreneur—by the numbers (raw & unfiltered):

- Launched 2 new AI courses (scrapped 1 that flopped 😅)
- Reached 9,700+ new students from 32 countries
- Wrote 34 LinkedIn posts (missed “weekly” goal by 18 weeks)
- Built 4 automations (saved 140+ hours)
- Tested 2 product ideas that went nowhere (seeded my newsletter)
- $128k in revenue (solo, no team)
- Learned 5 major lessons (biggest: talk to users earlier!)

Not every number is a win.  
But reviewing the honest stats—especially the misses—is what actually moves me forward.

Milestone post: hitting 60k subs on YouTube. Why: learning and communication.,"**Step 1: Purpose & Audience**

- What’s the purpose?  
  *Celebrate a milestone (60k YouTube subs) and reflect on the “why” behind it—learning and communication.*
- Who’s the target audience?  
  *Broad audience: aspiring creators, students, fellow entrepreneurs, those interested in AI/learning/content creation.*

---
**Step 2: Post Wireframe**

- Hook: Surprising/impactful insight about hitting 60k—tie to learning and communication.
- Meat: 
    - Briefly mention hitting 60k
    - Why this matters to Shaw (learning & communication as main drivers)
    - Maybe a quick anecdote about what he’s learned through teaching
    - Gratitude to audience/community
    - Small lesson or encouragement for those starting or growing
- CTA: Ask the reader what *skills* they’re working on learning/sharing.

---
**Step 3: Write the Body (“meat”)**

Hitting 60,000 subs isn’t really about the number.  
It’s a reminder that learning in public—and communicating what you learn—can change the trajectory of your life.

I started my channel to share what I was figuring out about AI. Along the way, I realized:
- The more clearly I explain something, the better I understand it myself
- The best “content ideas” usually come from answering real questions from real people
- Communication is itself a *technical skill*—one that compounds with practice

Thank you to everyone who watches, asks tough questions, and makes me a better teacher (and student).

If you’re thinking about sharing your own journey—start before you feel ready. The best lessons are often learned together.

---
**Step 4: CTA or Question**

What’s the #1 skill you’re focused on learning—or sharing—right now?

*Wait: per checklist, must pick ONE focus, so:*

What’s the #1 skill you’re focused on learning right now?

---
**Step 5: Hook — Step-by-Step Brainstorm**

5A: Brainstorm Hook Directions  
- [Personal story] “When I started, I never imagined I’d…”
- [Results/outcome] “60k subscribers—here’s the real lesson”
- [Problem/solution] “Most people focus on the metrics. Here’s what really matters.”
- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “I used to think teaching was just for experts. I was wrong.”
- [Trend/urgency] “The power of learning in public has never been greater…”

5B: Add Short Notes  
- [Personal story] “5 years ago, I was struggling just to explain AI to myself…”
- [Outcome] “Hitting 60k isn’t about the number, it’s about…” 
- [Problem/solution] “Metrics are nice, but learning & communication drive everything.” 
- [Clarity] “You can (and should) teach before you feel like an expert.”
- [Trend] “Now is the best time to build. Here’s why sharing what you learn is so powerful…”

5C: Choose the Strongest  
*Most clearly “Hitting 60k isn’t about the number, it’s about…” fits the “why: learning and communication” point and feels personal/direct.*

**Final Hook Candidates:**
A. “60,000 YouTube subscribers. But the real milestone is something bigger:”
B. “Hitting 60k on YouTube isn’t about the number. It’s about learning out loud.”
C. “60,000 people tune in for AI—but what I’ve learned about teaching has changed my life more.”

Go with B (clear, humble, direct, fits Shaw).

---
**Step 6: Review for Style, Sequence, and Voice**

- Clear, humble, first-person reflection on teaching and learning in public
- Lesson: Communication = technical skill
- Grateful, encouraging
- Single, focused CTA ending in only “What’s the #1 skill you’re focused on learning right now?”

---
**Step 7: Final Post**

---

Hitting 60k on YouTube isn’t about the number. It’s about learning out loud.

I started my channel to share what I was figuring out about AI. Somewhere along the way, I realized something surprising:

- The more clearly I explain an idea, the better I understand it myself
- My best “content” usually starts as a real question from someone in the community
- Communication is a technical skill—and it compounds with practice

Thank you to everyone who watches, asks tough questions, and makes me a better teacher (and student).

If you’re thinking about sharing your own journey, start before you feel ready. The best lessons are often learned together.

Corporate vs freelance data science. Key differences.,"Let's follow the 7-step approach outlined above:

---

**Step 1: Purpose & Audience**

- **Purpose:** Educate (clarify career paths for those considering data science roles)
- **Target Audience:** Aspiring or early-career data scientists, professionals deciding between corporate vs. freelance, current tech talent exploring career pivots

---

**Step 2: Wireframe**

- [Hook teasing a decision/confusion about which path is ""right""]
- [Direct breakdown: 3–5 key differences—work style, learning, risk, pay, freedom—using bullets]
- [Question CTA: Which path interests you most?]

---

**Step 3: The Meat**

Here’s what I see as the core differences:

**1. Stability vs Variety**
- Corporate: Steady paycheck, clear structure, bigger teams to support you
- Freelance: Every project is different, income varies, you run your own business

**2. Learning Curve**
- Corporate: Deep focus on a domain/product, long-term impact, resources for training
- Freelance: Forced to learn fast (new clients/new problems), broad skillset, more exposure to business & negotiation

**3. Autonomy**
- Corporate: Clear expectations, less say in direction, more guardrails
- Freelance: Total control over your time/client/project—but also full responsibility if things go wrong

**4. Pay & Perks**
- Corporate: Salary + benefits, potential for promotions, job security
- Freelance: Project-based pay (potential upsides), but you cover your own health care, taxes, time off

**5. Risk & Reward**
- Corporate: More predictable path, slower changes
- Freelance: Higher risk, but potential for higher reward if you can handle sales/client management

Both paths teach you a ton. It comes down to your risk tolerance, need for stability, and desire for autonomy.

---

**Step 4: CTA**

Which path fits your personality best?

---

**Step 5: Hook Brainstorm**

**5A: Directions**
- [Problem/solution] Struggling to pick between corporate and freelance data science? You’re not alone.
- [Personal story] Why I left corporate data science for freelance (and what changed)
- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] Most people have no idea how different these paths actually are.
- [Trend/urgency] “Freelance data science is booming—but is it right for you?”
- [Numbers] “5 Key Differences Between Corporate and Freelance Data Science”

**5B: Notes**
- [Problem/solution] Directly speaks to readers at a crossroads
- [Personal story] Would be stronger with a specific Shaw anecdote, but we lack this in prompt
- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] Good for myth-busting; positions Shaw as someone who’s seen both
- [Trend/urgency] Could reference AI-fueled growth in freelance
- [Numbers] Classic, clear structure, good for scan-ability

**5C: Pick Strongest Direction**
I’ll use the numbers angle for clarity, but try to sound conversational rather than listicle.

---

**Step 6: Review Style, Sequence, Voice**

- Concise, honest, uses bullets for readability
- Adopts Shaw's “mentor who’s been there” tone
- CTA is clear and singular

---

**Step 7: Final Post**

---

**5 Key Differences Between Corporate and Freelance Data Science**

If you’re weighing a data science job vs. starting out on your own, here’s what I wish someone had told me early on:

**1. Stability vs Variety**
- Corporate: Predictable salary, defined roles, team support
- Freelance: Every project is different, income fluctuates, you’re running your own business

**2. Learning Curve**
- Corporate: You’ll go deep in one domain, with time to master it (and often, training resources)
- Freelance: You’ll learn fast by necessity—each new client brings a new challenge

**3. Autonomy**
- Corporate: Clear expectations, guardrails, less say in big decisions
- Freelance: You call the shots (and deal with the fallout if things go wrong)

**4. Pay & Perks**
- Corporate: Steady salary, healthcare, paid time off, career ladders
- Freelance: Flexible rates and bigger upside—but you cover your own benefits and downtime

**5. Risk & Reward**
- Corporate: Smoother ride, slower to change
- Freelance: More uncertainty, but more potential if you’re comfortable with selling and self-management

Both tracks will teach you a ton. The right path comes down to your appetite for risk, stability, and independence.

"10 (non-technical) skills I needed to learn to survive as a data entrepreneur
Explaining technical ideas to non-technical people
Talking to customers
Formulating business problems
Asking good questions
Validating product/service ideas
Responding to emails quickly
Sales
Warm outreach
Making a landing page
Copy writing
","Let's walk through the reasoning step-by-step:

---

**Step 1: Purpose & Audience**

- *Purpose*: Educate/validate content idea; show the less-obvious, non-technical side of being a data/AI entrepreneur—encouraging others that technical skills alone aren’t enough.
- *Audience*: Aspiring data/AI entrepreneurs, technical professionals transitioning to entrepreneurship, maybe even early founders.

---

**Step 2: Post Wireframe**

- *Hook*: Call out the misconception that being a data entrepreneur is only about technical chops.
- *Meat*: List the 10 non-technical skills, with 1–2 lines of reflection: why each mattered, what surprised you, quick story.
- *CTA*: Ask about the hardest non-technical skill others had to learn.

---

**Step 3: Body of the Post**

When I became a data entrepreneur, I thought my technical skills were all I needed.  
But the biggest shocks came outside the codebase.  
Here are 10 *non-technical* skills that have mattered most in my journey:

1. **Explaining technical ideas to non-technical people**  
   If you can’t translate your insights, no one will care how advanced your model is.

2. **Talking to customers**  
   Building in a vacuum = guaranteed wasted time.

3. **Formulating business problems**  
   Starting with “How can I use AI here?” is backwards. Start with “What’s painful for the client?”

4. **Asking good questions**  
   The quality of your questions often matters more than your answers.

5. **Validating product/service ideas**  
   Don’t fall in love with your solution. Make sure someone actually wants it.

6. **Responding to emails (quickly)**  
   Speed builds trust with partners and clients.

7. **Sales**  
   No sales = no business, no matter how clever your analytics.

8. **Warm outreach**  
   Most new clients come through thoughtful relationship-building—not cold DMs.

9. **Making a landing page**  
   Even a basic, clear webpage signals professionalism (and brings inbound leads).

10. **Copywriting**  
    Clear, concise writing is the difference between confusion and action.

Building technical skills is just the start. Growing as an entrepreneur means developing a new toolkit—and half of it has nothing to do with code.

---

**Step 4: CTA/Question**

What non-technical skill do you wish you’d learned sooner?

**Step 5: Hook Reasoning**

*5A. Brainstorm Hook Angles:*
- [Problem/solution] Most people assume technical skills are 90% of the job—reality check.
- [Personal story] I failed at entrepreneurship until I nailed these non-technical skills.
- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] The 10 skills every technical founder ignores at their own risk.
- [Results/outcomes] I only started seeing traction after mastering these skills.
- [Question] What’s the hardest non-technical skill to learn as a data founder?

*5B. Notes for Each:*
- [Problem/solution] ""You can be the best coder in the room and still struggle to build a business.""
- [Personal story] ""I used to focus on models and code—missed the business piece entirely.""
- [Clarity/list] “10 non-technical skills every aspiring data entrepreneur must master.”
- [Results] ""Traction didn’t come from my technical skills—it came from these.""

8. **Warm outreach**  
   Most new clients come through thoughtful relationship-building—not cold DMs.

9. **Making a landing page**  
   Even a basic, clear webpage signals professionalism (and brings inbound leads).

10. **Copywriting**  
    Clear, concise writing is the difference between confusion and action.

Truth is, most of my growth happened *outside* the codebase.

","Let’s go step by step:

---

**Step 1: Purpose & Audience**  
- **Purpose:** Educate and inspire by sharing Shaw’s personal checklist of essential skills for (data) entrepreneurs—also to spark discussion/validation from fellow builders.  
- **Target Audience:** Aspiring data entrepreneurs, solo founders, technical freelancers considering entrepreneurship, and current tech builder-readers.

---

**Step 2: Wireframe**
- Hook: (Tease hard-won lessons/what most people miss, e.g., “Building a business isn’t just about the tech…” or “I thought I just needed to code—turns out you need so much more…”)
- Meat: Structured “15 lessons” list, each with 1-line explanation/mini-reflection, grouped/broken up for readability if needed.
- CTA: “Which one took you the longest to learn?” (Only one; prompts reflection/engagement.)

---

**Step 3: Body of Post (Meat)**

Here’s a draft, grouping for clarity:

---

On my path to becoming a data entrepreneur, I had to learn way more than just algorithms and models.  
Here are 15 skills that made the difference:
  
**1. Identifying real pain points:**  
Not every problem is worth solving—find the *urgent* ones.

**2. Coding (obviously):**  
But also knowing when “good enough” is fine.

**3. Using AI tools effectively:**  
The productivity unlock is real—if you know how to wield it.

**4. How to sell (even if you hate it):**  
You can’t build in a vacuum—revenue is proof.

**5. Talking to clients:**  
They rarely speak “data”—it’s your job to translate.

**6. Writing:**  
Clarifies ideas, markets you to clients, and builds trust.

**7. Making a website:**  
Done is better than perfect—get something live.

**8. Creating content:**  
Share your process, even if nobody’s watching at first.

**9. Cold outbound:**  
Sending that awkward DM or email gets easier (sorta).

**10. Just posting:**  
Press publish. Don’t wait for “perfect.”

**11. Looking foolish:**  
You *will* trip up in public. That’s how you grow.

**12. Learning to learn—constantly:**  
Tech shifts fast. Adapt or get left behind.

Each one cost me time (and a bit of pride), but put together, they compound into real results.

---

**Step 4: CTA/Question**

Pick one:

- “Which one took you the longest to master?”
- “What would you add to this list?”

Best is probably:  
**“Which one took you the longest to learn?”**

---

**Step 5: The Hook**

Step 5A: Brainstorm directions:

- [Expectations vs. reality] “Thought being a data entrepreneur was just coding—turns out that’s 10% of the job.”
- [Personal story/failure] “Looking foolish in public taught me more than any course ever did.”
- [Trend/urgency] “AI tools are just the start. Here’s the full toolkit I wish I had from day one.”
- [Results] “After X years and Y clients, here are the 15 skills no one tells you about.”
- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “What aspiring founders *think* they need vs. what actually matters…”

Step 5B: Add notes  
- [Expectations vs. reality]—Emphasize the non-obvious skills.
- [Personal story]—Admit the pain/awkwardness of learning in public.
- [Trend]—People over-index on AI/coding, underinvest in softer and sales skills.
- [Results]—No one told me about XYZ.
- [Beginner/expert]—The “hidden syllabus” of entrepreneurship.

Step 5C: Choose  
The “expectations vs. reality” and “hidden syllabus” resonate most for Shaw’s voice. Concrete, honest.

Final Hook:

**“Coding is just 10% of being a data entrepreneur. Here are the 15 skills nobody told me I’d need…”**

**Step 6: Review Style, Sequence, Voice**  
- Direct, honest, personal, clear  
- List format is scannable  
- CTA is laser-focused

**Coding is just 10% of being a data entrepreneur. Here are the 15 skills nobody told me I’d need…**

On my path to building my own data business, I quickly realized algorithms are the easy part.

Here’s what actually moves the needle:

1. **Identifying real pain points:**  
   Not every problem is worth solving—find the urgent ones.
2. **Coding (obviously):**  
   But also knowing when “good enough” is fine.
3. **Using AI tools effectively:**

5 side hustles that pay $1,500+/month (using your data science or ML skills)

Here are 5 repeatable ways I’ve seen data pros boost their income—without quitting their job:

1. **Freelance Model Audits**
   Companies need an outside eye on model bias, drift, or explainability. Audits can pay $500–$2k per project.

2. **AI-Powered Data Apps**
   Build simple GPT tools, dashboards, or automations for local businesses. Off-the-shelf custom solutions are in high demand.

3. **Technical Content Writing**
   Write tutorials, blogs, or technical deep-dives for ML/AI companies. Top outlets pay $0.20–$0.50/word if you’re hands-on.

4. **1:1 Mentoring or Micro-Courses**
   Tutor aspiring data scientists (on Superpeer, etc.) or package a niche skill into a short paid workshop.

5. **Open Source Consulting**
   Help startups or teams get unstuck with OSS like LangChain, LlamaIndex, or LLM eval tools. Even a couple of hours a week adds up.

None of these require a massive time investment—and all leverage the skills you’re already building.

"My $15,000 AI content creation strategy","**Step 1: Clarify the purpose and target audience**
- Purpose: Educate and validate content idea (sharing actionable, real-world strategy for others to learn from/replicate)
- Audience: Fellow entrepreneurs, solo founders, AI enthusiasts looking for ways to monetize content creation, creators considering using AI, people curious about real-world earnings from AI

**Step 2: Turn notes into a wireframe outline**
- Hook: Something that signals real numbers, specificity, and the ""how"" behind the results
- Meat: Break down (at a high level) what the strategy was, how AI played a role, what the process looked like, and a key takeaway (focus on actionability and honesty, not hype)
- CTA: Ask a single focused question—what interests the reader, or what would help them implement something similar

**Step 3: Write the body of the post first (the “meat”)**

Last quarter, I earned $15,000 using a simple AI-powered content workflow:

- First, I outlined 20+ content ideas based on audience questions (using ChatGPT for ideation & phrasing)
- Next, I automated the first draft writing—with prompts dialed in over time (the results took my editing from hours to minutes)
- For visuals, I used Midjourney and DALL-E to create custom images that stood out in the feed
- The final step: batch scheduling & optimizing every post (using automation to hit peak times and maximize engagement)
- What made the difference? I focused on solving specific audience pain points, not just “creating content”—and spent most of my time refining prompts and distribution

The result: 3x my usual reach, inbound consulting offers, and $15k in new business directly attributed to this content engine.

**Step 4: CTA/question**

How I made $15,000 with a simple (and repeatable) AI content workflow.

Last quarter, I earned $15,000 using a simple AI-powered content workflow:

- Outlined 20+ content ideas based on audience questions (using ChatGPT for ideation & phrasing)
- Automated the first draft writing—with fine-tuned prompts that saved hours on editing
- Created custom visuals in Midjourney and DALL-E to stand out in the feed
- Batch scheduled & optimized every post using automation to hit peak times

But the real difference? I stopped “just creating content” and obsessed over solving specific audience pain points—AI just made everything faster.

That led to 3x my normal reach, inbound consulting offers, and $15k in new business—all from this streamlined content engine.

"5 Tips for Building AI systems That Are Useless and Forgotten
Spend no time on data curation
Assume your data quality is good (without looking)
Only train one version of your model
Focus more on using new tech over the business problem
Don’t worry about evals until ready to push to prod
","Step 1: Purpose & Audience  
- **Purpose:** Educate (with a bit of tongue-in-cheek humor) about common mistakes that lead to failed AI projects—inviting reflection and better habits.  
- **Target Audience:** AI builders, technical founders, data scientists, and product managers who are hands-on in developing machine learning/AI solutions.

Step 2: Post Wireframe  
- Hook: Eye-catching, playful headline that calls out the “wrong way” to do things.  
- Body: List each mistake/tip with a 1–2 sentence explanation of why it’s problematic. Lightly humorous, but rooted in real advice.  
- CTA: Ask readers to share their own “unintentional sabotage” lessons from AI projects.

Step 3: Write the Meat (Body)  
Here are 5 surefire ways to make sure your AI project goes nowhere fast:
1️⃣ **Skip data curation.** Why bother understanding your inputs? Just accept whatever the last team handed you—typos, missing values, and all.  
2️⃣ **Assume your data is flawless.** Inspecting distributions or sampling rows is for worriers. Ship fast, diagnose later (when it’s too late).  
3️⃣ **Only train once.** You get one shot. No iteration, no experimentation—just pray you have perfect hyperparameters on the first try.  
4️⃣ **Chase new tech, not real problems.** Focus on stacking GPT APIs and the latest libraries. Ignore what actually delivers value to your users.  
5️⃣ **Forget evals until launch day.** Why test until you’re about to deploy? Surprise bugs and model underperformance make for great adrenaline.

Step 4: CTA/Question  
What’s one lesson you’ve learned (the hard way) building AI systems?

Step 5: Brainstorm Hooks  
5A. Brainstorm directions:  
- [Problem/solution]: “Why do so many AI projects fail?”  
- [Humor/parody]: “How to build the *least* useful AI system possible”  
- [Personal story]: “I’ve made (almost) every mistake on this list…”  
- [Trend/urgency]: “Still seeing the same AI project fails in 2024”  
- [Common confusion]: “It’s not the models—it’s these mistakes that sink your project”

5B. Add short notes:  
- [Problem/solution]: Addressing pitfalls before chasing shiny tools  
- [Humor/parody]: Deliberate “bad advice” listing what *not* to do  
- [Personal story]: “I’ve wrecked a few prototypes making these errors myself”  
- [Trend]: Despite all the LLM hype, basics matter more than ever  
- [Confusion]: “You’d be surprised how many teams skip these”

5C. Choose strongest angle & Write Hook:  
The *humor/parody* angle stands out and matches the tongue-in-cheek style of the “tips.” Let's go with that.  
**Final Hook:**  
Want to guarantee your AI project is useless and forgotten? Here’s the *perfect* roadmap.

Step 6: Review for Style, Sequence, and Voice  
- Hook is clear and playful.  
- Advice is punchy, each point is crisp and actionable, but humor is present.  
- CTA is singular.

"How to Build a (Local) Document QA Bot with Ollama + Gradio 🧑‍💻
Format
pain point/problem
Solution (project idea)
Steps (pseudo code)
Helpful libs/resoucres
","Step 1: Purpose & Audience  
- **Purpose:** Educate and empower technical audience to build a practical, privacy-focused AI tool (local doc QA bot), while soft-promoting hands-on learning and open-source tools.
- **Audience:** AI builders & tinkerers (developers, engineers, solo founders), especially those tired of cloud lock-in or wanting local/private data solutions.

Step 2: Wireframe  
- Hook: Pain Point (“Ever tried to build a doc QA bot, but...”) or Personal (“Here’s how I built a local doc QA bot...”)  
- Problem: Current cloud-based doc QA bots = privacy concerns, setup pain  
- Solution: Local doc QA bot using Ollama (for LLM) + Gradio (UI), works with your own documents, runs locally  
- Steps: High-level, actionable pseudo-code/process  
- Helpful libs + resources: Concrete tools/repos  
- CTA: “What would you build with this?”

Step 3: Write the Meat  

Ever wish you could query your own files—privately, from your laptop? Most doc QA bots need cloud APIs or hand over your data to a third party... Not great for privacy or cost.

The fix: Build a local document QA bot using Ollama (for LLMs) and Gradio (for a friendly UI). You control your data, the model runs on your machine, and it works with your own PDFs, TXT, or whatever files.

**Here’s the high-level game plan:**  
1. **Ingest documents:** Load and chunk your files (PDF/TXT).  
2. **Embed & index:** Generate vector embeddings (e.g., using SentenceTransformers or Ollama’s embedding models).  
3. **Question input:** User asks a question via Gradio UI.  
4. **Retrieve:** Find top relevant chunks using similarity search.  
5. **Answer:** Pass those chunks—plus the question—to Ollama (your local LLM) to generate an answer.  
6. **Return:** Display the answer in Gradio.

**Handy tools & libraries:**  
- Ollama (local LLM runner, supports models like Llama3)  
- Gradio (easy Python UI)  
- LangChain (pipelines and vector stores—optional, but helpful)  
- PyPDF2 / Unstructured (document parsing)  
- SentenceTransformers (for embeddings)

There are tons of ways to extend this: multi-file support, answer highlighting, chatbot interface—you name it.

Step 4: CTA / Question  
What’s the first doc you’d want to ask your own QA bot about?

Step 5: Hook Development

**5A: Brainstorm Hook Directions**
- [Problem/solution] “Tired of sending sensitive docs to the cloud? Here’s a fix.”
- [Personal story] “I needed a private way to ask questions about my files, so I built this.”
- [Trend/urgency] “Local AI is going mainstream—don’t get left behind.”
- [Results/outcomes] “Built a doc QA bot that runs 100% local. Here’s how.”
- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “Local doc QA bots aren’t as hard as you think.”

**5B: Add Short Notes**
- [Problem/solution] privacy, security, no cloud bills, DIY control
- [Personal story] learning, built mine for company docs, surprised how easy
- [Trend/urgency] people looking for open source/DIY, Ollama surge
- [Results] Show outcome—QA bot, live demo
- [Clarity] Walkthrough, de-mystify

**5C: Choose Direction and Write Final Hook**

Strongest hook for this crowd: Problem/solution + slight urgency

**Final Hook:**  
Tired of handing your private documents to the cloud just to get answers?  
Here’s how to build your own local doc QA bot—in an afternoon.

Step 6: Review for Style & Voice  
- Direct, plain-spoken  
- Calls out pain, provides concrete value  
- Actionable and empowering  
- Single clear CTA

Step 7: Write Final Post

**Tired of handing your private documents to the cloud just to get answers?  
Here’s how to build your own local doc QA bot—in an afternoon.**

Most “document Q&A” tools want you to upload sensitive files or burn through cloud credits. It’s not great for privacy—or your wallet.

The fix: build a doc QA bot that runs 100% on your own laptop.  
All you need is Ollama (runs open-source LLMs locally) and Gradio (for a dead-simple UI).

Here’s the rough blueprint:
1. **Ingest docs** — Load your PDFs, TXTs, or whatever, and break text into chunks.
2. **Embed & index** — Create vector embeddings for those chunks (with SentenceTransformers or Ollama).
3. **Ask a question** — Simple UI built in Gradio.
4. **Retrieve** — Find top-matching chunks with similarity search.
5. **Answer** — Feed the most relevant parts, plus your question, to Ollama’s LLM for an answer.
6. **Return** — Show the answer in Gradio—no cloud, no data leaks.

**Helpful libs/resources:**  
- Ollama (open LLM runner)  
- Gradio (Python UI)  
- LangChain (workflows & vector stores)  
- PyPDF2/Unstructured (read PDFs)  
- SentenceTransformers (embeddings)

Bonus: You can extend this for multi-file reads, citations, or even chat formatting.

"My biggest mistake: pursing AI consulting when my goal was to develop products.
Free AI consultations (for target customer)
Make content about it
Book more calls
Make more content
Build prototypes
Get feedback from customers
Repeat
","**Step 1: Purpose & Audience**

- **Purpose:** Share a personal lesson about the misalignment between consulting work and product building, educate about finding product-market fit, and softly promote free AI consultations to spark engagement and start a useful feedback/content loop.
- **Target audience:** Fellow entrepreneurs, solo AI builders, aspiring product creators, and maybe early-stage consultants—people thinking of pivoting from consulting to product.

**Step 2: Wireframe**

```
[Hook: Strong, confessional statement or question about the consulting vs. product trap]

[Meat: Honest story about chasing consulting work when the real goal was to build products. Outline the realization, and the new strategy: free consults for target customers → content → book more calls → build prototypes → get real-time feedback → repeat. Emphasize: this is how you validate faster and align your work with your real goals.]

[CTA: What's the #1 thing holding you back from reaching your first real customers?]
```

---

**Step 3: The Meat**

For a long time, I spent my energy chasing AI consulting gigs—building custom tools and workflows for anyone willing to pay. 

It paid the bills, but it pulled me further from my real goal: developing products I truly believed in.

So I’ve shifted my focus:
- Offer free 1:1 AI consults (but only to my actual target customers).
- Turn every session into actionable content.
- Book more calls via that content.
- Use these conversations to build scrappy prototypes.
- Ship, get feedback, improve, repeat.

**Step 5: The Hook**

**Step 5A: Brainstorm Hook Directions**

1. [Problem/solution] Tired of consulting draining your energy from your real dream—product building?
2. [Personal story] My biggest mistake as an AI entrepreneur? Chasing consulting revenue instead of user feedback.
3. [Results/outcomes] How free consulting calls turned into my shortcut to customer feedback and real products.
4. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] Most solo founders get trapped in the consulting loop. Here’s how I broke free.
5. [Quote] “Consulting pays for your next pivot—but it won’t build your dream product.”

**Step 5B: Fleshing Out Directions**

1. [Problem/solution] “You want to build products, but you’re stuck doing consulting work just to keep the lights on.”
2. [Personal story] “I thought consulting gigs were a shortcut. Turns out, they’re a detour.”
3. [Results/outcomes] “Booking 10 free AI consults led to my best product ideas.”

My biggest mistake as an AI entrepreneur? I chased consulting work when what I really wanted was to build products.

For months, I spent my energy building custom solutions for anyone willing to pay. It paid the bills, but it pulled me further from my actual goal: developing products that mattered to me (and my target users).

So I’ve changed my approach:

- Offer free AI consults—but only for my target customers.
- Turn every session into actionable content.
- Book more calls through that content.
- Build prototypes based on real conversations.
- Ship, gather feedback, iterate, repeat.

This loop gets me closer to product-market fit—while creating value at every step.

5 Resume Myths That Kept Me Unemployed,"Step 1: Purpose & Target Audience  
- Purpose: Educate, share personal lessons, validate content idea  
- Target Audience: Job seekers learning to break into tech/AI, recent grads, professionals looking to pivot, Shaw’s broader network interested in career advice

Step 2: Post Wireframe  
- Hook: 1–2 lines that grab attention, possibly “resume mistakes you’re making” or “mythbusting” angle  
- Meat: List 5 myths (with quick explanations), brief story of being stuck/unemployed, what actually worked  
- CTA: ONE focused question—e.g., “Which myth trips you up most?” or “What held you back in your job search?”  

Step 3: Write the Meat of the Post

Getting stuck in resume advice cost me months of rejection. Here are 5 myths I wish I’d seen through earlier:

1. **“Your resume needs to be 1 page.”**  
   I crammed years of experience into a single page, hiding my best work. What matters: clarity and relevance, not length.

2. **“List every job—even the unrelated ones.”**  
   Turns out, no one cares about that summer gig in retail unless it fits the story you want to tell. Customize for the role.

3. **“Use big words to sound impressive.”**  
   I used jargon, but was told my resume was confusing. Simple, direct language *always* wins.

4. **“Skip the summary—it’s a waste of space.”**  
   My best interviews came after I wrote a clear, honest summary about what I actually wanted.

5. **“Applying everywhere increases your chances.”**  
   I thought mass-applying was smart. But targeted applications + a tailored resume led to actual interviews.

Most progress came when I focused on *clear, honest storytelling*—not following “rules.”  

Step 4: Write the CTA/Question

What resume myth took you the longest to see through?

Step 5: Hooks — Brainstorm Directions

- [Problem/solution] “Resume ‘best practices’ kept me unemployed. Here’s what finally worked.”
- [Personal story] “I spent months job hunting—these 5 resume myths were a big reason why.”
- [Results/outcomes] “My interview rate jumped 5x when I ditched these resume mistakes.”
- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “Most resume advice online is wrong. Here are 5 myths to ignore.”
- [Trend/urgency] “Hiring in tech is brutal—but most rejections start with these common resume myths.”

Step 5B: Add notes  
- Problem/solution: Emphasize stuck phase, transformation after ditching myths  
- Personal story: Mention months unemployed, first-hand frustration  
- Results: Quantify impact—“5x interviews,” big shift after changing approach  
- Beginner-to-expert: Position as mythbusting, Shaw’s honest experience  
- Trend/urgency: Tech job market is rough, this makes it rougher

Step 5C: Choose/Write Hook  
Best angle here: Personal story PLUS mythbusting—makes it feel both actionable and honest.

Final Hook:  
I stayed unemployed for months—because I believed these 5 resume myths.

Step 6: Review  
- Tone: Honest, clear, self-reflective  
- Flow: Hook > key lessons > single question  
- Scannable, actionable, fits Shaw’s style

• 3 LLM use cases (that are not a chatbot) ◦ But how do I actually use ai—3 real world use cases ◦ Lead scoring ◦ Lead (unsupervised) clustering. Customer segmentation ◦ LI post writer (FT an LLM to write LI posts) ◦ LI post scoring ◦ Concept math?,"Let’s reason step by step using your provided content!

---

**Step 1: Purpose & Target Audience**

- **Purpose:** Educate and inspire the audience with real, practical use cases for LLMs that go beyond chatbots.
- **Audience:**  
    - Technical professionals (“builders,” engineers, PMs, founders)  
    - Curious LinkedIn users who know LLMs are powerful but feel stuck on “real” use cases

---

**Step 2: Wireframe**

- Hook: “Everyone talks about AI chatbots. But what else can you *actually* build with LLMs?”
- Meat: 2–3 sentences of context, followed by bullet points with use cases:
    - Lead scoring
    - Customer segmentation (unsupervised clustering)
    - LinkedIn post writer (LLM fine-tuned for personal brand voice)
- CTA: “What’s the most underrated non-chatbot use case you’ve seen?”

---

**Step 3: Body/Meat**

Everyone’s building chatbots. But LLMs are way more flexible than most people realize.

Here are 3 practical use cases I’ve seen *actually* working in the wild:
- **Lead Scoring:** Scan incoming leads and automatically score for fit based on your historical closing data and key signals—not just keywords.
- **Customer Segmentation (Unsupervised Clustering):** Use LLMs to group your customers with natural language logic (interests, needs, behaviors)—even if you don’t have labeled data.
- **LinkedIn Post Writer:** Fine-tune an LLM on your best performing content to generate draft posts in your own brand voice. (I use this for 80% of my ideas.)

LLMs aren’t just for conversation—they’re the engine for workflows that used to need manual effort, dozens of rules, or lots of engineering.

---

**Step 4: CTA/Question**

What’s the most underrated non-chatbot use case you’ve seen?

---

**Step 5: The Hook**

**Step 5A: Brainstorm 3–5 hook directions**

1. [Problem/solution] “Stuck thinking LLMs are just chatbots? Here are 3 real-world ways I actually use them.”
2. [Personal story] “I stopped building chatbots—and started using LLMs for workflows like these.”
3. [Trend/misconception] “‘AI = chatbot’ is the biggest myth in tech right now.”
4. [Beginner–expert clarity] “3 underrated LLM projects you can build (no chatbot required)”
5. [Numbers/results] “80% of my workflows now run on LLMs—and none of them are chatbots.”

**Step 5B: Add short notes to each direction**

1. “Helps unstick folks from the ‘just chatbots’ rut, short and spicy.”
2. “Makes it personal—a builder’s shift in perspective.”
3. “Challenges a widely held belief, piques curiosity.”
4. “Actionable for builders—what should you build next?”
5. “Concrete, shows real adoption—implies real value.”

**Step 5C: Choose strongest + write final hook**

Let’s use the “AI = chatbot” myth, since it’ll grab attention and open minds.

**Step 6: Review for Style, Sequence, Voice**

- Approachable, technical, action-oriented
- Directly discredits a misconception, then provides clear bullet points
- Uses personal example (“I use this for 80% of my ideas.”)
- Asks a question to the reader (single, focused)

---

**Step 7: Final Post**

---

**Biggest myth in AI: ‘LLMs are just for chatbots.’**

Here are 3 non-chatbot workflows you can actually build (or steal) today:

• **Lead Scoring:** Let an LLM analyze your inbound leads, pull out the key signals, and score for sales fit—based on *your* past wins.
  
• **Customer Segmentation (Clustering):** Use LLMs to naturally group customers by behavior, need, or interest—even without labeled data. It’s like auto-segmenting your audience, but smarter.
  
• **LinkedIn Post Writer:** Fine-tune an LLM on your own content to generate draft posts in your brand’s voice. (I use this for 80% of my ideas—it’s a time saver and a creative boost.)

LLMs aren’t just for conversation—they’re workflow engines for things that used to need endless rules or manual effort.

What is data quality? Accuracy and diversity.,"Step 1: Purpose & Target Audience  
- Purpose: Educate on a core concept in AI/data—what “data quality” really means (and why it matters).
- Audience: AI learners, new practitioners, and anyone interested in building technical projects (especially those following Shaw’s “explain like I’m five” educational style).

Step 2: Wireframe  
Hook: (To be determined after body/CTA)
Body: Explains data quality simply, focusing on the ideas of “accuracy” and “diversity,” why both matter, and what can go wrong if you ignore either.
CTA: Asks audience for how they assess or improve data quality in their own projects.

Step 3: Write the Body (“Meat”)  
When it comes to building anything with data—whether it’s a small side project or the backbone of an AI agent—quality is everything. But what does “data quality” actually mean?

For me, the two big pillars are accuracy and diversity:

- **Accuracy**: The data is correct and reflects reality. If your data’s off, your results will be too. It’s the old “garbage in, garbage out” problem.
- **Diversity**: Your data covers a wide enough range of scenarios, so your models or insights don’t just work in one situation. Without it, your tools can’t handle the real world.

Miss one of these, and you end up with blind spots, bias, or just plain wrong answers—no matter how fancy your algorithms are.

Step 4: CTA/Question  
How do you check for accuracy and diversity in your own datasets?

Step 5: Hook  
**Step 5A: Brainstorm directions**
- [Problem/solution] “Most AI projects fail before they start—because of bad data.”
- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “Data quality isn’t just about clean numbers.”
- [Personal story] “Early on, my data looked great—until my model hit a wall.”
- [Common misconception] “People obsess over models—but ignore this step.”
- [Practical outcome] “Want better results? Fix this before you even code.”

**Step 5B: Add short notes**
- [Problem/solution] Many projects sink because the data misses accuracy/diversity—explain why.
- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] Most think “cleaning” = good data; it’s deeper.
- [Personal story] Learned the hard way—great-looking data failed in real world.
- [Common misconception] Everyone tunes the model, few check the dataset.
- [Practical outcome] Simple advice = actionable improvement for readers.

**Step 5C: Choose strongest direction and write hook**  
Let’s choose the “Common misconception” direction for maximum resonance and clarity.

Final Hook:  
Most people obsess over their models—but ignore the quality of their data.

Step 6: Review for Style, Sequence, and Voice  
- Friendly, technical mentor vibe.
- Clear explanations, short and direct.
- Honest framing—shares what’s often missed, invites reflection.
- Bullets and whitespace for easy scanning.

Step 7: Write the Final Post

Demo Upwork Job Dashboard,"**Step 1: Purpose & Audience**  
- Purpose: Validate a content idea—demonstrate a real Upwork job dashboard built with AI (possibly with a tutorial angle or to showcase what’s possible with agents/tools), and optionally drive interest for deeper content (e.g. YouTube/tutorial).  
- Audience: Freelancers and solopreneurs curious about using AI/automation for client management; digital freelancers (esp. Upwork users); fellow AI builders.

---

**Step 2: Post Wireframe**  
1. Hook: Bold statement or question about managing Upwork jobs smoother with AI, teasing a demo or what’s possible  
2. Meat:  
   - Quick backstory on *why* Shaw made a dashboard (pain points—messy inboxes, scattered job info)  
   - What the dashboard shows (with 1–2 bullets for features: auto-track job status, highest value leads, reminders for follow-up, etc.)  
   - Screenshot or emoji ""peek"" at dashboard if possible  
   - Real impact (“I’ve saved X time” or “My response rate is up X%”)—even if rough  
3. CTA: Invite to comment if they want a how-to/tutorial.

---

**Step 3: Write the Meat (Body)**

Juggling jobs on Upwork used to mean endless browser tabs, missed messages, and forgetting which clients to follow up with.

So I built a simple Upwork Job Dashboard, powered by a few AI automations and a Google Sheet.

Here's what it does for me:
- Automatically pulls my active job listings and applications into one place
- Highlights the highest-value leads so I know where to focus
- Reminds me to follow up with clients before opportunities go cold

The result?  
I spend less time lost in my inbox—and more time actually winning good projects.  
(Plus, I never forget to send a follow-up message again.)
