"AI principles I know at 29, I wish I had known at 24.
- Don't use AI
- Focus on problems not tech
- Spend more time on data curation
- Data quality > data quantity
- Run experiments","**Step 1: Purpose & Audience**
- **Purpose:** Share hard-earned lessons about working with AI, aimed to educate and inspire earlier-career peers (and possibly validate these principles with others in the field)
- **Target audience:** Young professionals, aspiring AI practitioners, technical students/engineers considering careers in AI/ML

**Step 2: Wireframe**
```
[Bold opening hook contrasting “then and now” — what I wish I knew at 24]

[Short reflection: Being 5 years in gives perspective. List 5 concise, hard-won AI lessons/principles.]

[End with a question: What’s a principle you wish you’d learned sooner?]
```

---

**Step 3: Body (“meat”)**

Looking back, there are a handful of AI principles I wish I’d internalized earlier. Here are the main ones:

- Don’t reach for AI unless it’s really needed—lots of “AI” problems are actually just good product or software problems
- Focus on the problem, not the hottest model or toolkit
- Spend more time on data curation than model tinkering
- Data quality > data quantity, every time
- Run small experiments before full builds—short feedback loops = faster learning

---

**Step 4: CTA or Question**

What’s one principle you wish you’d known earlier in your career?

---

**Step 5: Hook — Brainstorm Directions**

5A. **Hook directions:**
- [User’s phrasing] “AI principles I know at 29, I wish I had known at 24.”
- [Personal lesson] “If I could talk to my 24-year-old self about AI…”
- [Problem/solution] “Most new AI engineers focus on the wrong things—here’s what I wish someone told me at the start.”
- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “The biggest mistakes I made early in my AI journey (and what I’d do differently).”
- [Numbers/list] “5 hard-won AI lessons from 5 years in the field”

5B. **Add notes:**
- [User’s phrasing] “Direct and relatable. Would resonate with others reflecting on their growth.”
- [Personal lesson] “Sets up hard-won experience—subtle credibility.”
- [Problem/solution] “Highlights pain of wasted time or wrong focus.”
- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “Makes this about pitfalls to avoid—a warning.”
- [Numbers/list] “Actionable, clear that there will be takeaways.”

5C. **Choose strongest:**  
Let’s use a slightly refined version of the user’s own phrasing—simple, direct, personal—paired with a chronological frame for empathy and clarity.

**Final Hook:**  
“If I could give my 24-year-old self advice about working in AI, here’s what I’d say:”

---

**Step 6: Full Draft**

If I could give my 24-year-old self advice about working in AI, here’s what I’d say:

After 5+ years down this road, some “rules” are much clearer:
- Don’t use AI just because it’s cool—sometimes simpler software is the answer
- Always start from the actual problem, not the latest tool
- Invest time in curating data, not just fiddling with models
- Data quality beats data quantity every time
- Run experiments early. Fast feedback beats big up-front bets

If you’re earlier in your journey, I hope some of these lessons save you time.

What’s one principle you wish you’d learned sooner in your career?

---

**Step 7: Review for Style, Voice, and Flow**
- **Em dash audit:** Only one, used judiciously; could remove for even more clarity
- White space and bullets: present
- No repeated words/phrases in hook/first lines
- Tone: Honest, approachable, plainly written—matches Shaw
- No made-up numbers or details
- Only one CTA at the end

---

**Step 8: Final Post**

If I could give my 24-year-old self advice about working in AI, here’s what I’d say:

After 5 years in the field, these principles stand out:
- Don’t use AI just because it’s cool. A lot of “AI” problems just need good software.
- Focus on the problem, not the latest tech.
- Spend more time curating your data than tweaking your models.
- Data quality beats data quantity every single time.
- Run experiments early and often. Fast feedback always wins.

If you’re earlier in your journey, I hope this saves you some headaches.

**Step 6: Draft of Full Post**

Building your own AI agent isn’t as hard as it might seem.

When I first heard about “AI agents,” I imagined something only PhDs or top-tier engineers could build.

Here’s the truth:  
— With the right tools and mindset, anyone can build a simple, working AI agent in an afternoon.

Here’s how to get started:  
1. **Pick a small, useful problem.** For example: “Reply to customer emails” or “Summarize meeting notes.”
2. **Use accessible tools.** Services like OpenAI’s Assistants API, LangChain, or even Zapier with GPT add AI superpowers to your workflow—no need to start from scratch.
3. **Focus on function over perfection.** Aim for a working prototype, not a polished product.

The key: Don’t overthink it. Your first agent doesn’t need to be fancy—just useful.

How I went from $0 to $70k: lessons learned along the way

Starting from nothing isn’t glamorous—and there were plenty of mistakes, false starts, and months with no progress.

But looking back, a few key lessons made all the difference:

- Consistency > Perfection
Shipping small projects regularly matters more than waiting for everything to be perfect.

- Fail fast, learn faster
Every “failure” is just data. The quicker the feedback, the faster you improve.

- Build with your strengths
I made more progress sticking with what I know, instead of chasing every shiny new tool.

- Community accelerates growth
Learning from others and sharing wins (and mistakes) sped up my journey more than anything else.

- Focus on learning early
Revenue takes time. Early on, skill-building and process beat quick wins.

The journey to $70k wasn’t a straight line—but every lesson made it a little less daunting.

50k subs YouTube milestone,"Step 1: Purpose & Audience  
- Purpose: Celebrate hitting 50,000 YouTube subscribers, gratitude, and maybe a lesson or encouragement for others growing online.  
- Target audience: Aspiring YouTubers, creators, fellow educators, AI/tech peers, Shaw’s LinkedIn audience (broadly, entrepreneurial/tech-inclined folks).

---

Step 2: Post Wireframe  
- Hook: Call out the 50k milestone in a way that pulls in readers (excitement, reflection, a lesson).  
- Meat:  
    - Briefly acknowledge the milestone.  
    - Express honest feelings (excitement, shock, gratitude).  
    - Mention a high-level lesson/insight from the journey—keep it honest and practical (don’t dramatize).  
    - Encourage or motivate: tip or reminder for others growing a channel or project.  
- CTA: Single focused question. Example: “If you’re building online, what’s your #1 challenge right now?”  
- (Optional P.S.)

---

Step 3: Write the Body (“Meat”)  
50,000 subscribers was never a number I seriously imagined when I uploaded my first video.  
I still remember staring at 17 views and thinking, “Will anyone care about this stuff?”  
The real secret? Consistent (even imperfect) action stacks up faster than you think.  
Looking back, the channel’s growth is really just a byproduct of learning out loud, helping others, and sticking with it longer than my doubts.  
To everyone who’s ever watched, commented, or shared—you made this possible.  
Thank you.

Step 4: CTA or Question  
What’s the hardest part for you about growing online?

---

Step 5: Brainstorm Hooks (Step 5A, 5B, 5C)

A. [Milestone/Announcement] “50,000 YouTube subscribers—still sinking in.”
  - Simple, direct: emphasis on the milestone and sense of surprise.

B. [Personal story/humility] “When I started, I never thought 50k subscribers was even remotely possible.”
  - Personal, cements the gap between then and now.

C. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “Here’s what 50,000 YouTube subscribers actually looks like (hint: it’s not overnight success).”
  - Sets expectation for honesty.

D. [User’s own phrasing] “50k subs YouTube milestone”
  - Could be an understated, matter-of-fact announcement vibe.

E. [Lesson learned] “The only thing more important than ‘great content’? Relentless consistency.”

Step 5B: Notes for each  
A. [Milestone/Announcement]: Feels celebratory, straightforward  
B. [Personal story/humility]: Emphasizes authenticity, relatable doubts  
C. [Beginner-to-expert clarity]: Dismantles overnight myth, appeals to process-focus  
D. [User’s phrasing]: Minimalist, effective if paired with strong body copy  
E. [Lesson learned]: Slightly more “advice-y,” good for engagement with creators

Choose (C): Most compelling for Shaw’s voice—clear, honest, invites curiosity about process > result.

Hook:

2. No repeated phrases at open.
3. Body is not repeating hook.
4. No assumed external info.
5. White space and breaks for scannability.
6. Flow is natural, direct, honest.

"Reminder: being rich isn’t about what’s in you bank account, but what’s in your mind… keep learning","Step 1: Purpose and Audience
- Purpose: Inspire and motivate Shaw’s audience to value learning as core to long-term success, not just financial wealth.
- Target Audience: Broad—fellow entrepreneurs, creators, students, and anyone focused on growth.

Step 2: Post Wireframe
- Hook: Challenge common understanding of “wealth.”
- Meat:
    - The difference between material riches and mental riches.
    - Personal/professional outcomes are the fruit of our mindset, not our bank balance.
    - The power of continued learning—no one can take it away from you.
- CTA: What’s one thing you’re learning right now that’s making a difference?

Step 3: Body (“Meat”)
Most people define rich by a number in their bank account. 

But real wealth is what you carry in your mind—the skills, ideas, and frameworks that unlock new opportunities again and again.

Money can come and go, but knowledge is the kind of asset that nobody can take from you.

The more you invest in learning, the more you set yourself up for future opportunities (and, yes, more financial success over time).

Step 4: CTA
What’s one thing you’re learning right now that’s making a difference?

Step 5A: Brainstorm Hook Directions
- [User’s own phrasing] “Being rich isn’t about what’s in your bank account, but what’s in your mind.”
- [Problem/Solution] “Most people chase financial milestones…but they’re playing the wrong game.”
- [Personal Story] “The best investment I’ve ever made? Never in the stock market—always in my own learning.”
- [Beginner-to-Expert Clarity] “You can lose money overnight. Skills last a lifetime.”
- [Results/Outcomes] “Every dollar I’ve made in my career started as something I decided to learn.”

Step 5B: Notes to Each Direction
- [User’s own phrasing] Simple, bold, makes you pause and re-think “rich.”
- [Problem/Solution] Many focus on money metrics, but knowledge compounds better.
- [Personal Story] Humble, first-person angle; avoid unless given specifics.
- [Beginner-to-Expert Clarity] Challenge the assumption that money = safety.
- [Results/Outcomes] Show how knowledge pays off more reliably than cash.

Step 5C: Choose Strongest and Write Hook
Decision: Let’s build directly from the user’s phrasing, since it’s bold and clear. Add an opening for that personal, direct feel.
Hook: “Real wealth isn’t measured by your bank account—it’s measured by your mindset.”

Step 6: Draft Full Post

Real wealth isn’t measured by your bank account—it’s measured by your mindset.

- No repeated words or hooks
- Language is clear, direct, friendly, inviting
- Personal but not fabricated (“real wealth is what you carry in your mind” — connects but doesn’t assume a story)

"A problem with AI today is that it means different things to different people. Share 3 types of software.

Software 1.0 = Rule-based systems
Software 2.0 = ML
Software 3.0 = LLMs","**Step 1: Purpose & Audience**  
- Purpose: Educate (clarify what “AI” means by categorizing types of software, and give language to help discussions)  
- Audience: Broad LinkedIn audience, especially those curious or confused about the current state of AI—potential students, tech-curious professionals, practitioners who want to communicate better

[CTA inviting readers to share which “software era” they spend most time with or which one they find most interesting]
```

---

**Step 3: The Meat**

A big issue with “AI” right now: everyone’s using the term, but often talking about completely different things.

Here’s how I think about the different “eras” of software:

- **Software 1.0: Rule-based systems**  
  Explicit “if X, then Y” instructions. Everything’s hand-coded. Think: Excel macros, old-school calculators, classic business logic.

- **Software 2.0: Machine Learning**  
  Models trained on data to spot patterns and make predictions. You write code that trains on lots of examples instead of rules. Examples: spam filters, image recognition, recommendation engines.

- **Software 3.0: LLMs (Large Language Models)**  
  Systems that “understand” and generate human language at scale, trained on huge swaths of the internet rather than task-specific datasets. Examples: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini.

Being able to name these categories makes talking about AI so much less confusing—and helps teams align on what they're actually discussing (or building).

---

**Step 4: CTA**

Which “software era” do you work with most often?

---

**Step 5: Hook Brainstorm**

1. [User’s own phrasing]  
   “A problem with AI today is that it means different things to different people.”
2. [Problem/solution angle]  
   “Everyone’s talking about AI—but are we even talking about the same thing?”
3. [Beginner-to-expert clarity]  
   “Not all ‘AI’ is created equal. Here’s how I break down the types.”
4. [Numbers/trends]  
   “3 types of ‘AI software’—and why the differences matter now more than ever.”
5. [Personal lesson]  
   “It took me years to realize most AI debates are just… people talking about totally different kinds of software.”

**Notes:**
- [User’s own phrasing] calls out the confusion, but is a bit soft.
- [Problem/solution] establishes the stakes and draws in confused professionals.
- [Beginner-to-expert] aims for clarity and “aha!” for those overwhelmed by jargon.
- [Numbers/trends] is direct and actionable.
- [Personal lesson] adds a bit of humility and experience.

*Will go with [Problem/solution]: “Everyone’s talking about AI—but are we even talking about the same thing?” It’s direct, calls out the confusion, and sets up the “here’s how I clarify it for myself (and hopefully for you)” flow.*

---

**Step 6: Full Post Draft**

Everyone’s talking about AI—but are we even talking about the same thing?

“AI” gets tossed around so much these days that it’s easy to forget not all software in this space works the same way.

Here’s how I break it down:

- **Software 1.0: Rule-based systems**  
  Hand-coded logic. If X, then Y. No surprises, but limited flexibility. Think calculators, Excel macros, old-school business apps.

- **Software 2.0: Machine Learning**  
  Instead of coding rules, you let the model learn patterns from lots of data. Useful for predictions, speech recognition, recommendations.

- **Software 3.0: LLMs (Large Language Models)**  
  Systems like ChatGPT that generate and understand human language, trained on huge amounts of diverse text—not just task-specific datasets.

Being clear about which type we’re discussing can save teams (and conversations) hours of confusion.

Which “software era” do you work with most often?

---

**Step 7: Review for Style and Flow**

- One em dash, in initial hook (“Everyone’s talking about AI—but”)—justified for conversational tone.
- Bulleted, concise, approachable, plain language.
- CTA is single, focused, and flows.
- No assumptions about Shaw’s own experience.
- White space is solid.

"3 communication tips for data scientists.
use stories
Use examples
Use analogies","**Step 1: Purpose & Audience**

- **Purpose:** Educate (share tips to help data scientists communicate more effectively)
- **Audience:** Data scientists (especially those who want to improve how they share technical insights—could also be useful to technical peers, aspiring data scientists)

**Step 2: Wireframe**

- 1–2 line hook (problem, solution, or pain point for data scientists re: communication)
- The “meat” – 3 communication tips: use stories, use examples, use analogies, with a brief comment on each
- A single, focused question or CTA inviting discussion (e.g., invite reader to share their favorite communication tip or a story where this helped)

**Step 3: The Body**

“Here are a few approaches I’ve found helpful for better communication as a data scientist:
- Use stories: Framing findings or insights as a story keeps people engaged and makes the data feel relevant.
- Use examples: Instead of stats-on-stats, walk your audience through a real (or hypothetical) case so the impact is tangible.
- Use analogies: Mapping complex technical concepts to familiar, everyday ideas is the bridge between data science and understanding.”

**Step 4: CTA/Question**

“What’s one communication move that’s made your technical work more accessible?”

**Step 5: Brainstorm Hooks**

**Step 5A: Directions**
1. [Problem/solution] “Data scientists don’t have a communication problem—until no one ‘gets’ their insights.”
2. [Numbers/listicle] “3 ways to make your data science talks actually land.”
3. [Relatability/pain point] “Ever had people’s eyes glaze over during your presentation?”
4. [Personal story, but none supplied, so skip]
5. [User’s phrasing] “3 communication tips for data scientists.”

**Step 5B: Notes**
1. [Problem/solution] People miss the adoption/impact step due to bad communication.
2. [Numbers/listicle] Orients toward quick, practical value.
3. [Relatability/pain point] Everyone’s felt ignored in a presentation; this could pull readers in.
4. [Personal story] Not applicable per guidelines—no Shaw experience detailed.
5. [User’s phrasing] Clarity and promise right up front.

**Step 5C: Pick strongest direction & write hook**

Let’s go with angle #3: relatable pain point—it grabs attention, then flips to value.

**Draft hook:**  
“Ever had your audience’s eyes glaze over during a technical presentation?”

**Step 6: Compile Draft**

Ever had your audience’s eyes glaze over during a technical presentation?

If your insights are falling flat, chances are it’s a communication problem— not a technical one.

Here are 3 approaches that work for me:
- **Use stories:** Frame your findings as a story to keep people engaged and make the data feel relevant.
- **Use examples:** Go beyond statistics. Walk your audience through a real (or hypothetical) case so the impact feels real.
- **Use analogies:** Map complex technical concepts to everyday ideas. Analogies are the bridge between data science and actual understanding.

What’s one communication move that’s made your technical work more accessible?

**Step 7: Review for Style, Voice, and Flow**

Ever had your audience’s eyes glaze over during a technical presentation?

If your insights are falling flat, chances are it’s a communication problem—not a technical one.

Here are 3 approaches that have worked for me:
- **Use stories:** Frame your findings as a story—people tune in when there’s a narrative.
- **Use examples:** Skip the stats-only approach. Walk people through a real (or hypothetical) case to make the impact tangible.
- **Use analogies:** Bridge technical concepts to everyday ideas. Analogies make the unfamiliar click.

What’s one communication move that’s made your technical work more accessible?"

I paid a $100k/mo entrepreneur to talk to me. Here’s what I learned.

- Customer pain points matter more than your background. If you solve a real problem, credentials are secondary.
- Price for value, not hours.
- When you increase your price, don’t rush the ask—a higher ticket usually needs longer copy and more education.
- Get hyper-clear on your “avatar,” then attract them naturally with genuinely helpful free content.
- The difference between $10k/mo and $100k/mo is usually strategy, not tech skills.

**Step 2: Wireframe**

```
[Hook: Tease the $10k milestone and promise an inside look]

[Meat: Share that this was Shaw’s first $10k month, break down the main revenue sources as bullet points. Reflect briefly on what contributed to this result or a quick lesson.]

[CTA: Simple, focused question or call to discussion]
```

---

**Step 3: Body (“Meat”)**

June was my first $10k month since going all-in on entrepreneurship.  
Here’s how the revenue broke down:

- Freelance AI consulting: $5,500
- Course sales: $2,000
- 1:1 coaching: $1,000
- Newsletter sponsorships: $800
- Misc. (affiliates, small projects): $700

Most of my income still comes directly from services (consulting/teaching), but the first real up-tick in “scalable” income (like courses and sponsorships) was a turning point.

If you’re working toward your first $10k month, know that it took months of experimenting, building trust, and learning which offers actually resonate.

I’m nowhere near “passive income” yet, but I’m proud of the progress—and excited to see how things evolve from here.

Managing technical debt when coding with AI. 2 things I consider. 1) my experience with the lang/library and 2) how many times I need to run project.,"### Step 1: Purpose & Audience

- **Purpose:** Educate on how Shaw thinks about technical debt in AI-driven coding projects, and share actionable, practical heuristics.
- **Audience:** Fellow AI developers, engineers, solo founders, and technical creators building with AI tools and codebases.

---

### Step 2: Wireframe

```
[Engaging hook about technical debt and AI coding]

[Shaw’s 2 criteria for managing technical debt—experience with stack, and project lifespan/run count. His practical reflections.]

[Single question to drive discussion]
```

---

### Step 3: Write the Body (“meat”)

Managing technical debt gets more interesting when you’re using AI to code—or when you’re coding on top of AI.

I approach it by considering two things before making tech stack decisions:

1. **How familiar am I with the language/library?**  
   If I know the stack well, I’m less likely to accumulate “hidden” debt (stuff that bites later). If it’s new/unknown, I build extra margin into the timeline (and expect unexpected headaches).

2. **How many times will I need to run or maintain this project?**  
   If it’s a one-off script or prototype, I’ll tolerate a bit more mess. For long-term automation or code that will run regularly, I’m much stricter about quality, refactoring, and documentation upfront.

By balancing these two, I can ship quickly *without* racking up painful debt that slows future projects.

---

### Step 4: CTA/Question

How do you decide when to ship fast vs. slow down and manage technical debt?

---

### Step 5: Brainstorm Hooks

#### Step 5A: Labeled Directions

1. [Problem/solution] “Most AI coders forget this about technical debt...”
2. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “When should you care about technical debt when coding with AI?”
3. [Personal reflection] “Here’s my litmus test for taking on technical debt in AI projects.”
4. [Common pain point] “Rushed AI code = technical debt. Here’s how I avoid the worst pain.”
5. [Numbers/structure] “2 things I consider before letting tech debt creep into my AI code.”

#### Step 5B: Notes

1. [Problem/solution] Call out how AI speeds up coding, but tech debt can accumulate rapidly.
2. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] Many new devs either over-optimize or let everything get messy.
3. [Personal reflection] Direct statement: “I use this quick checklist.”
4. [Pain point] Everyone knows the regret of messy prototype code becoming production code.
5. [Numbers/structure] “2 things” makes the advice actionable and concise.

#### Step 5C: Pick strongest direction & write final hook

I’ll choose the [Numbers/structure] angle: it’s clear, concrete, and directly mirrors Shaw’s own note.

**Final Hook:**  
“2 quick checks to manage technical debt when coding with AI (so your weekend projects don’t become future headaches)”

### Step 6: Draft Full Post

2 quick checks to manage technical debt when coding with AI (so your weekend projects don’t become future headaches)

When working with AI, it’s easy to move fast and break things—but not so fun when you have to keep fixing them.

Here are the 2 factors I think about before I hit “ship”:

1. **My experience with the language or library:**  
   If I know it well, I’ll be faster, and the odds of hidden issues go down. If it’s all new, I give myself extra time and expect to clean up later.

2. **How many times I need to run or maintain this project:**  
   For something that runs once? I don’t sweat the details. But if it will become part of a product or automation, I invest up front in better design and documentation.

Balancing these lets me ship experiments quickly *without* tripping over my own shortcuts down the line.

How do you decide when to ship fast vs. slow down and manage technical debt?

---

### Step 7: Review for Style, Voice, and Flow

- No em dashes beyond the hook (acceptable for style emphasis in first line)
- White space and concise bullets for scannability
- Clear, actionable, and in Shaw’s honest, technical voice
- CTA is a single, focused question

"Share blog: Local LLM fine-tuning on Mac

Context:
This article is part of a larger series on using large language models (LLMs) in practice. In a previous post, I showed how to fine-tune an LLM using a single (free) GPU on Google Colab. While that example (and many others) readily runs on Nvidia hardware, they are not easily adapted to M-series Macs. In this article, I walk through an easy way to fine-tune an LLM locally on a Mac.","Step 1: Post Purpose & Target Audience  
- Purpose: Promote Shaw’s new blog post about local LLM fine-tuning on Mac and share a practical resource.
- Target Audience: AI practitioners, hobbyists, and learners (especially those using or limited to Macs, or looking for approachable ways to do LLM fine-tuning without cloud GPUs).

Step 2: Wireframe  
[Hook teasing accessible LLM fine-tuning on Mac]  
[Context: This continues Shaw’s LLM-in-practice series, noting that most guides assume Nvidia hardware, then introduces the new walkthrough for Mac]  
[Link to the blog post]  
[CTA: Focused question inviting readers to share their Mac/LLM pain points or questions]

Step 3: Body (“Meat”)  
A lot of LLM fine-tuning guides focus on cloud GPUs—or assume you’re running an Nvidia setup. But if you’re working on a Mac (especially one with Apple Silicon), things are less straightforward.  
In my latest post, I share a step-by-step guide to fine-tuning an LLM locally on Mac (no server rental, no need for Nvidia hardware).  
This article is part of my ongoing series on using LLMs in practice. In my last post, I focused on Colab and GPUs; this time, I’m breaking things down for fellow Mac users.

Step 4: CTA or Question  
What’s your biggest blocker when it comes to running LLMs locally on your Mac?

Step 5A: Hook Brainstorming Directions  
1. [User’s own phrasing] “Local LLM fine-tuning on Mac: Step-by-step”  
2. [Problem/solution] Most LLM tutorials leave Mac users behind—here’s a fix  
3. [Personal story] “When I tried to fine-tune an LLM on my M2 Mac, I hit wall after wall…”  
4. [Trend/urgency] Running LLMs locally is more possible than ever—even on your Mac  
5. [Beginner frustration] “Stuck trying to fine-tune an LLM without an Nvidia GPU?”

Step 5B: Short notes for each direction  
1. Clean, direct, but not too punchy as a hook  
2. Teases a frustration lots of Mac users have—excludes, then offers solution  
3. Only use if user mentions a personal struggle (not in provided notes)  
4. Trendy but lacks the pain/relief angle  
5. Calls out a problem many face; could be strong

Step 5C: Choose & Write Hook  
Strongest direction: [Problem/solution] “Most LLM tutorials leave Mac users behind—here’s how to catch up.”

Step 6: Draft Full Post

Most LLM tutorials leave Mac users behind—here’s how to catch up.

A lot of fine-tuning guides assume you’re running Nvidia hardware or renting a GPU server.

But what if your main machine is a Mac? Things get tricky—fast.

So, for my latest blog post, I put together a step-by-step walkthrough on how to fine-tune an LLM locally on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) Macs.

It picks up where my last guide (fine-tuning with a free Colab GPU) left off—but this time, everything works natively on a Mac.

If you’ve been stuck wondering how to get started with LLMs and you don’t want to rely on cloud platforms, this one’s for you.

Cut through the AI noise: these are the two books I’d actually recommend for LLM builders.

If you’re serious about building with LLMs, there are two books worth having close by.

The first is *Super Study Guide: Transformers & Large Language Models*—a solid reference for quickly looking up concepts or architectures.

The second is *Building LLMs for Production*, which goes beyond theory. It’s a guidebook made by practitioners, for practitioners. If you want practical advice for taking LLM-driven applications from prototype to production (with all the pitfalls in between), this is one to check out.

Both are packed with distilled insights for anyone working hands-on with AI—and they’ve earned a permanent spot on my digital bookshelf.

What book or guide has been most helpful for you as you’ve built with LLMs?

---

**Step 7: Review for Style, Voice, and Flow**

- Only one em dash (“Both are packed with distilled insights for anyone working hands-on with AI—and they’ve earned a permanent spot on my digital bookshelf.”) This one is OK for tone/voice.
- White space and bullet use: solid. Could use a bit more scannability.
- Honest, approachable, suggestion-based—not “I did X and succeeded!” which Shaw would not claim without evidence.
- Tone is helpful, conversational, focused on audience.
- Follows Shaw’s usual structure and clarity.
- No repeated phrases or numbers in the hook/first lines.

**Step 8: Final Post**

"Share blog: multimodal models. 3 ways to make LLMs multimodal.
LLM + Tools
LLM + Adapters
Unified Models","Step 1: Purpose & Audience
- Purpose: Share and promote Shaw’s new blog about 3 ways to make LLMs multimodal (educate + drive traffic).
- Target Audience: AI engineers, technical founders, and anyone curious about language models, especially those following Shaw for practical, technical insights.

Step 2: Post Wireframe
- Hook: Expose a misconception or pain point about LLMs being “only text” and tease actionable solutions.
- Meat: Briefly outline the 3 approaches (LLM + Tools, LLM + Adapters, Unified Models) and invite readers to check out the full blog for examples or deeper explanations.
- CTA: Ask which approach readers want to learn more about.

Step 3: Write the Meat
Lots of people think large language models (LLMs) only “understand text”—but actually, there are several ways to make them work with different data types: images, audio, video, and more.

In my latest blog post, I break down 3 practical ways to make LLMs multimodal:
1. LLM + Tools: Connect an LLM to APIs or services for vision, audio, etc.
2. LLM + Adapters: Attach small neural adapters, translating new modalities into tokens LLMs understand.
3. Unified Models: Train models like GPT-4o or Gemini to natively handle multiple data types.

If you’re looking to prototype agents or apps that go beyond plain text, understanding these strategies can give you a real edge—whether you’re hacking on side projects or shipping in production.

Step 4: CTA/Question
Which approach do you want to see deep-dived next?

Step 5: Hook Reasoning

Step 5A: Brainstorm labeled directions
- [Problem/solution] ""Can LLMs really go beyond text?""
- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] ""3 ways to make LLMs multimodal (with code examples)""
- [Results/outcomes] ""How to turn LLMs into multimodal AI (vision, audio, and more)""
- [Trend/urgency] ""The most in-demand LLM skill of 2024? Multimodality.""
- [User’s own phrasing] N/A—no existing user phrasing given.

Step 5B: Short notes to each direction
- [Problem/solution] Addresses a common myth; positions post as “you’re missing out if you think LLMs only do text.”
- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] Simple “3 ways” list for scannability.
- [Results/outcomes] Promises readers can build “vision/audio” LLM apps, not just chatbots.
- [Trend/urgency] Hooks people following hot AI trends; claims multimodality is a major shift.

Step 5C: Choose hook
The [Problem/solution] angle clearly teases an “aha” moment and will grab more engagement. Let’s go with something like:
“Think LLMs can only do text? Think again.”

Step 6: Draft the Full Post

Think LLMs can only do text? Think again.

Most people are surprised to learn LLMs can be made multimodal—able to process images, audio, and more—with a few key strategies.

In my latest blog post, I break down 3 practical ways to get there:
1. LLM + Tools: Combine LLMs with APIs or external services for vision, audio, etc.
2. LLM + Adapters: Add lightweight neural adapters so LLMs can interpret new data types.
3. Unified Models: Train systems (like GPT-4o or Gemini) to natively handle multiple formats at once.

Birthday post. Past year recap by the numbers.,"**Step 1: Purpose & Audience**  
- **Purpose:** Personal milestone/share behind-the-scenes journey/give thanks
- **Audience:** Shaw’s network—fellow entrepreneurs, students, followers interested in Shaw’s growth story and transparency

---

**Step 2: Post Wireframe**
```
[Hook: Bold, number-driven or reflection on growth]

[Meat: Recap of the past year “by the numbers” (e.g., projects shipped, followers/subscribers, courses created, milestones, lessons if relevant). Tone is honest, humble, action-oriented. If numbers aren’t provided, keep it high-level/general.]

[CTA: “What’s a milestone you’re proud of this year?” or similar single question.]
```

---

**Step 3: Body (""Meat"")**

This past year brought some of the biggest changes in my career so far:

- [X] New projects shipped
- [Y] Community/followers/subscribers grown
- [Z] Courses/content created
- [Optional] Honest reflection on what surprised/challenged me

*Note: Since specific numbers weren’t given, I’ll write placeholders using “X,” “Y,” etc. for factual integrity, making it transparent and inviting.*

---

**Step 4: CTA**

What’s a milestone you’re proud of this year?

---

**Step 5A: Hook Directions**

- [Numbers-first] “What a year: My last 12 months by the numbers”
- [Reflection] “Another year older—a lot to be grateful for as I look back”
- [Personal Milestone] “One year, [X] projects, and countless lessons learned”
- [Gratitude] “Thank you for supporting me through a year of big changes”

**Step 6: Draft Full Post**

One year older. Here’s what changed—in numbers.

Every year on my birthday, I like to take stock of the journey so far. This past year was no different, but looking back, the growth feels bigger than ever.

Here’s my 12-month recap by the numbers:
- [X] new projects shipped
- [Y] new community members joined (hello to all who’ve connected!)
- [Z] new courses and resources created
- [Optional] [Lessons or learning moments—if no numbers, swap this for “Countless lessons learned, sometimes the hard way”]

No matter what the numbers are, the real win has been connecting with so many of you, learning together, and building things that (hopefully) make a difference.

Thank you for being part of it.

What’s a milestone you’re proud of this year?

---

**Step 7: Review for Style, Voice, Flow**

- One em dash (“—”) used once, appropriate for voice.  
- White space and bullet points used for scannability.  
- Tone: friendly, honest, humble, and community-focused.  
- No assumption or fabrication of personal experiences/results.  
- CTA is clear and singular.  
- No external resources or specifics, in line with accuracy principle.

Milestone post: hitting 60k subs on YouTube. Why: learning and communication.,"**Step 1: Purpose & Target Audience**  
- **Purpose:** Share and celebrate the 60k YouTube subscribers milestone, reflect on what the journey has taught about learning and communication.
- **Target Audience:** Fellow creators, learners, aspiring YouTubers, and Shaw’s professional network who are interested in education, content creation, and AI.

---

**Step 2: Wireframe**  
```
[Engaging hook about the milestone, tied to learning/communication]

[Reflection on what reaching 60k subs means, what was learned about teaching/communication through the process, personal thoughts, a nod to the ongoing journey]

[Focused CTA: Ask the audience about their biggest learning from creating/sharing online]
```

---

**Step 3: Meat of the Post**  
- Hit 60k YouTube subs  
- Started with 0, saw every new sub as a person interested in learning  
- Learning (as a teacher) how to communicate clearer with every video  
- Realized teaching is as much about clear communication as it is about knowledge  
- Still on the journey, audience feedback shapes content and improves skills  
- Gratitude to community

---

**Step 4: CTA or Question**  
- What’s the biggest thing you’ve learned from sharing your ideas online?

---

**Step 5: Hook**  
**Step 5A: Labeled directions for hooks**  
- [Milestone/Numbers] “60,000 people subscribed to my YouTube channel.”
- [Learning/Process] “Teaching on YouTube taught me more about learning than any classroom.”
- [Problem/Solution] “Most people think teaching is about knowledge. It’s really about this one thing…”
- [Personal Reflection] “I started with zero subscribers. Here’s what 60,000 taught me.”
- [Gratitude/Community] “None of this would be possible without you.”

**Step 5B: Notes**  
- [Milestone/Numbers] Surprising impact of 60k on learning/communication  
- [Learning/Process] Communication is a skill built video by video  
- [Problem/Solution] It’s not just about what you know—how you share it matters  
- [Personal Reflection] The growth from zero is slow and shapes you  
- [Gratitude/Community] Audience is an active participant in the process

**Step 5C: Choose strongest direction and write final hook**  
Chosen: [Learning/Process] + [Milestone/Numbers] (“Teaching on YouTube taught me more about learning than any classroom. 60,000 subscribers later, here’s what stands out…”)

**Crafted Hook:**  
Reaching 60,000 YouTube subscribers taught me more about learning—and communication—than any classroom.

---

**Step 6: Draft of Full Post**

Reaching 60,000 YouTube subscribers taught me more about learning—and communication—than any classroom.

When I hit publish on my first video, I had zero audience and more doubts than confidence.

But every new subscriber was another person trusting me to explain, simplify, and share what I know.

What I’ve realized on this journey: It’s less about what you *know* and more about how you *communicate* it.

Each video is a feedback loop—your comments, questions, and even criticisms make me a better teacher. They push me to clarify, refine, and rethink how I explain ideas, especially when it comes to AI and tech.

Growing this channel isn’t just a numbers game—it’s a journey in learning how to *teach* better.

Thanks for being a part of this process.

What’s the biggest thing you’ve learned from sharing your ideas online?

---

**Step 7: Review for Style, Voice, and Flow**

- Only one em dash used, justified for flow
- No repeating phrases/numbers/hook in first lines
- Body expands on learning and communication, not just repeating hook
- No specifics claimed about results beyond the milestone
- White space and structure for easy reading
- Shaw’s voice: Clear, honest, focuses on teaching, grateful, invites community to reflect

Corporate vs freelance data science. Key differences.,"Let's work step by step as per the instructions:

---
### Step 1: Purpose & Audience

- **Purpose:** Educate by highlighting the key differences between corporate (employee) and freelance data science roles.
- **Target audience:** Data scientists exploring career options, aspiring freelancers, people curious about alternative career paths.

---
### Step 2: Wireframe

1. **Hook:** High-contrast, curiosity-building line comparing the two paths.
2. **Body:** List or thread-style breakdown of key differences—culture, process, autonomy, income stability, scope, etc.
3. **CTA/Question:** Invite readers to share their experiences or thoughts.
4. **(P.S. if needed):** Only if there's a meta note or resource.

---
### Step 3: Write the Meat

Corporate Data Science:
- Structured projects with clear stakeholders.
- Larger teams, more specialized roles.
- Slower decision cycles; more bureaucracy.
- Steady paycheck but less direct control over projects.

Freelance Data Science:
- Wear all the hats: pitching, delivery, follow-up.
- More project variety but often less technical depth per project.
- Unpredictable income, but full flexibility.
- Faster iterations and more learning per client.

Both tracks have trade-offs—risk vs. stability, depth vs. breadth, predictability vs. autonomy.

---
### Step 4: CTA/Question

- What’s one difference you’d add to the list?

---
### Step 5: Brainstorm Hook Directions

**5A: Labeled Directions**
1. [Problem/solution] Most data scientists wonder which path is “right”—here’s what changes when you go freelance.
2. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “Corporate vs. freelance data science: The key differences no one talks about.”
3. [Trend/urgency] “More data scientists are going freelance than ever before. Should you?”
4. [Personal story/lesson] “After seeing both sides, these differences surprised me most…”
5. [User’s own phrasing] “Corporate vs freelance data science. Key differences.”

**5B: Notes Per Direction**
1. Problem/solution: Audience unsure which career path to take; clear snapshot.
2. Clarity: Audience expects a list; leans into “no one talks about.”
3. Trend: Taps into FOMO and transition in the field.
4. Personal story: Would require Shaw’s direct experience (unless user provides).
5. User phrasing: Direct, less punchy.

**5C: Choose the Strongest**
I will go with #2 (clarity/list) because it’s actionable and opening up a clear, no-fluff breakdown.

**Final Hook:**  
“Corporate vs. freelance data science: The differences that matter most (but rarely get discussed).”

---
### Step 6: Draft the Full Post

Corporate vs. freelance data science: The differences that matter most (but rarely get discussed).

A lot of data scientists wonder if they should stick with their corporate gig or jump into freelancing. Here’s where these two paths really diverge:

**Corporate Data Science:**
- Projects and deadlines are shaped by company priorities.
- Work in larger teams with more defined roles.
- There's often more bureaucracy and slower decision-making.
- Steady salary, but less say over what you work on.

**Freelance Data Science:**
- You’re the project manager, salesperson, and engineer in one.
- More project variety, but sometimes less technical depth per client.
- Income can fluctuate, but you set your hours and choose your work.
- Fast pivots; you learn a ton working directly with clients.

It’s always a trade-off: stability vs. freedom, depth vs. variety.

What’s one difference you’d add to the list?

---
### Step 7: Review for Style, Voice, and Flow

- Only use one em dash! (Check: there’s only one, in the last line (“It’s always a trade-off: stability vs. freedom, depth vs. variety.”) - consider just using a colon, or turning into two sentences for clarity.)
- Clear, scannable bullets.
- No assumed personal story from Shaw.
- Tone is peer-to-peer, friendly, direct.
- Invites discussion, not a hard sell.

---

---

**Step 1: Purpose & Audience**

- **What is the purpose of this post?**
    - Educate and validate content idea; share personal insight on the “hidden curriculum” for technical founders/data entrepreneurs.
- **Who is the target audience?**
    - Aspiring or current data entrepreneurs, technical founders, and data scientists interested in starting their own business.

[Hook: A bold statement or surprising list intro about non-technical skills for data entrepreneurs]

[Meat: List 10 non-technical skills needed, with a sentence or quick example each for clarity/context]

[CTA: Focused question—prompt audience to share their own skills or reflect on one they needed]

[P.S. if applicable]
```

---

**Step 3: The Body**

10 (non-technical) skills I needed to learn to survive as a data entrepreneur:

1. Explaining technical ideas to non-technical people  
2. Talking to customers  
3. Formulating business problems  
4. Asking good questions  
5. Validating product/service ideas  
6. Responding to emails quickly  
7. Sales  
8. Warm outreach  
9. Making a landing page  
10. Copywriting  

When I started, I thought all I needed was strong technical chops.

Turns out these “soft” skills were just as critical for paying the bills and keeping the business alive.

---

**Step 4: CTA/Question**

What non-technical skill do you wish you’d learned sooner as an entrepreneur?

---

**Step 5: Brainstorm Hooks**

**Step 5A—Hook Directions:**
1. [Listicle/Pattern Interrupt]—“10 (non-technical) skills I needed to learn to survive as a data entrepreneur”
2. [Problem/Solution]—“Your coding skills can get you started, but these 10 ‘soft’ skills will keep you in business.”
3. [Confession/Humility]—“No one tells you this: Most of the work as a data entrepreneur isn’t technical.”
4. [Beginner-to-Expert Epiphany]—“Before launching my data business, I thought tech skills were all I needed—I was wrong.”
5. [User’s phrasing]—Directly use “10 (non-technical) skills I needed to learn to survive as a data entrepreneur” as the first line.

**Step 5B—Notes for Each Direction:**
1. [Listicle]—Straightforward, signals value and clarity. (“10 must-have skills” works well on LinkedIn)
2. [Problem/Solution]—Contrast technical vs. non-technical; appeals to audience who thinks tech skill suffices.
3. [Confession]—Human & honest, sets a personal tone. May be good for engagement.
4. [Beginner-to-Expert Epiphany]—“I was surprised how much time I spent on X, Y, Z.”
5. [User’s phrasing]—Direct, leverages the input. Clear and to-the-point.

**Step 5C—Choose the Direction and Final Hook:**

I’ll go with [Confession/Humility] for authenticity + clarity:

“Most of my milestones as a data entrepreneur came from *non*-technical skills.”

Alternate (if more direct):  
“Most of my milestones as a data entrepreneur had nothing to do with code.”

But since Shaw’s style favors clarity and friendliness, I’ll combine clarity and the user’s direct approach for approachability:

Step 2: Post Wireframe  
- Hook: A bold promise or confession that grabs attention (e.g., “No one told me you’d need these 15 skills…”)
- Meat: Brief intro, then the 15-point list, possibly with a comment or clarifier for a few surprising/uncomfortable ones
- CTA or question: Singular, focused—ask which of these readers struggle with, or what’s missing
- (P.S.: Optional depending on what emerges)

---

Step 3: The Meat (Body)  
Becoming a (data) entrepreneur means wearing a lot of hats—and learning way more than just how to code.  
Here are 15 things I’ve had to pick up (sometimes the hard way):

1. Identifying real pain points
2. Coding (still table stakes)
3. Using AI tools effectively
4. Selling (not just building)
5. Talking to clients (and actually listening)
6. Writing clearly
7. Making a decent website
8. Creating content people care about

- [User’s phrasing] “15 things I had to learn to become a (data) entrepreneur”  
- [Behind-the-scenes/reality check] The “unsexy” skills no one tells you about  
- [Personal challenge] Why I still feel like a beginner, even after X years  
- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] 15 skills you can’t skip if you want to build & sell products as a technical founder

5B: Notes for each  
- [Problem/solution] Most technical folks get stuck because they only invest in one of these skills (coding)—here’s what they miss  
- [User’s phrasing] Could work, but could be made more personal or provocative  
- [Reality check] No one tells you about the “foolish” stuff: just posting, being awkward, etc.  
- [Personal challenge] Admitting it’s uncomfortable to do most of these—helps normalize struggle  
- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] Practical list, not fluff—makes the journey more relatable

---

Step 2: Post Wireframe  
[Engaging hook: Reality check about $1,500/month side hustles for data pros]  

[List of proven, real side hustle ideas w/ bullet points + typical earning potential. Note: Only include rates from user input, don’t invent any.]  

[Simple, focused CTA: “Which one would you try first?” or “What side hustle would you add?”]

---

Step 3: Write the body (“meat”)  

Want to make an extra $1,500/month on top of your data role?  
Here are practical side hustles I see data scientists and MLEs actually doing:
- Technical blogging (Medium/TDS): Get paid to share your expertise.
- Mentorship calls ($250–$350/hr): Help others level up, one call at a time.
- AI consulting calls ($100–$500/hr): Advise teams on their toughest AI/ML challenges.
- Freelance dev work ($50–$250/hr): Apply your coding chops to part-time projects.
- Freelance technical writing ($100–$200/article): Demystify complex topics for a wider audience.
- YouTube channel: Educational videos can bring in both ad revenue and inbound opportunities.
- Newsletter: Grow your audience & monetize with sponsorships or paid content.

---

Step 4: CTA or Question  
Pick one focused CTA:  
What side hustle would you add to this list?

---

Step 5: Write the Hook  
Step 5A: Brainstorm labeled directions:  
- [Problem/solution] “Tired of salary caps? Here’s how data pros make extra income”  
- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “Most data scientists don’t realize how many practical side hustles are right in front of them”  
- [Results/outcomes] “How to earn $1,500/month as a data pro—no startup required”  
- [User’s own] “$1,500 side hustles for data scientists & MLEs”  
- [Trend/urgency] “In 2024, you don’t have to quit your job to build a meaningful second income as a data scientist”

Step 5B: Add short notes  
- [Problem/solution] Many see themselves as “employee only,” but real side income is more accessible than they think.  
- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] List makes it seem possible; not everyone is after an extra $10K, $1.5K is realistic.  
- [Results/outcomes] Concrete numbers speak to seriousness, not just time-wasting online (Teal Deer: “here are real rates”).  
- [User’s] Direct, clear, targets main audience.  
- [Trend/urgency] Shows how solo operators can win in 2024.

Step 5C: Choose strongest direction and write the hook  
Best: [Results/outcomes]  
How data scientists are earning $1,500/month on the side (without building a company).

How data scientists are earning $1,500/month on the side (without building a company).

Want to add extra income on top of your data role?

Here are practical side hustles I see data scientists and MLEs actually doing:

- Technical blogging (Medium/Towards Data Science): Get paid to share your expertise.
- Mentorship calls ($250–$350/hr): Help others level up, one call at a time.
- AI consulting calls ($100–$500/hr): Advise teams on their toughest AI/ML challenges.
- Freelance dev work ($50–$250/hr): Apply your coding chops to part-time projects.
- Freelance technical writing ($100–$200/article): Demystify complex topics for a wider audience.
- YouTube channel: Educational videos can bring in both ad revenue and inbound opportunities.
- Newsletter: Grow your audience & monetize with sponsorships or paid content.
- Write a book: Package your knowledge into a product that keeps selling.
- Content sponsorships: Once you have an audience, brands will want to reach your readers/viewers.

All of these can be started 100% solo—no cofounder, no outside funding, just your skills and a bit of willingness to experiment.

**Step 3: Body (“meat”)**  
In the past year, my content creation system powered by AI hit a $15,000 milestone.  
But the strategy wasn’t some overly complex tech stack or secret growth hack—it was about finding the right balance between automation and authenticity.

Here’s the high-level formula that worked for me:
- **Leverage AI for idea generation and first drafts:** I used AI tools to speed up brainstorming, research, and rough drafts (nothing fancy, just consistent use).
- **Keep the editing and voice human:** Every post was reviewed and given my personal touch—audiences can spot ‘robotic’ content a mile away.
- **Batch workflow:** I set aside blocks of time weekly to create, edit, and schedule—this maximized consistency.
- **Repurpose everything:** Video, text, snippets—AI made it easier to repackage ideas across platforms.

**Step 3: Body (“Meat” of the Post)**

Have sensitive docs you *don’t* want to send to the cloud? Most QA bots require uploading everything to a third-party platform, which isn’t great for privacy or control.

Here’s a better way: build your own local document QA bot using Ollama for LLMs and Gradio for a simple UI.

Here’s the general approach:

1. **Load Your Model Locally:** Use Ollama to spin up your chosen LLM (e.g., Llama 3) on your machine.
2. **Ingest Documents:** Parse your PDFs or docs with a lib like LangChain or unstructured.io.
3. **Chunk & Embed:** Split docs into chunks, compute embeddings (e.g., with sentence-transformers).
4. **Build Retrieval Pipeline:** Store embeddings locally; at query time, use vector search (like FAISS) for relevant context.
5. **Gradio App:** Wrap it all in a Gradio UI so you can upload docs and ask questions in your browser.

Helpful libraries/resources:
- **Ollama:** Easy way to run LLMs locally ([https://ollama.com](https://ollama.com))
- **Gradio:** Simple Python UI ([https://www.gradio.app/](https://www.gradio.app/))
- **LangChain:** Tools for doc parsing, chunking, and pipeline glue
- **FAISS:** Local vector search
- **sentence-transformers:** For creating text embeddings

**Step 3: Body (“Meat”)**

- Brief reflection on the main mistake: got caught up in consulting because it was an easy win/money, but didn’t move me toward my goal: products.
- A better path: run free AI consultations for ideal users, make content about the insights, use calls to book more, build prototypes based on real problems, get tight feedback, repeat. 
- This cycle exposes real need, keeps you embedded with your exact audience, and naturally transitions from service to scalable product.

**Step 4: CTA/Question**

- *What’s your process for validating ideas or new product directions?*

**Step 5: Hook Ideation**

- **[User’s own phrasing]:** My biggest mistake: pursuing AI consulting when my goal was to develop products.
- **[Problem/Solution]:** Want to build AI products? Here’s the cycle that works better than “just consulting.”
- **[Personal story]:** I chased consulting gigs and got stuck on the freelancing hamster wheel...
- **[Results/Process]:** My repeatable system for turning conversations into real, validated AI products.
- **[Beginner-to-expert clarity]:** Why “consulting now, product later” almost killed my progress (and how I fixed it).

**Notes per hook:**
- User phrasing: blunt, honest, focuses on mistake
- Problem/Solution: helps audience transition from consulting/service to scalable products, actionable steps
- Personal: relatable, “stuck in consulting” is a vibe many founders have felt
- Results/Process: walks people through the loop, practical
- Beginner-expert: reveals why “just do consulting” can kill momentum if your end goal is products

**Final pick:**  
User’s own phrasing is clear and blunt, but combining it with the “freelancing hamster wheel” insight gives it more punch and relatability.

- Make content about the real problems you uncover (no fluff).
- Use that content to book more calls and deepen your understanding.
- Build quick prototypes based on what you’re seeing.
- Get real feedback from the customers who actually have the problem.

"5 Resume Myths That Kept Me Unemployed
more is better
I don’t need to tailor my resume
I need an objective statement
Writing down my experience is enough
I don’t need a portfolio","Step 1: Answer the following two questions

- **What is the purpose of this post?**
  - Educate. The goal is to debunk common resume myths that hold back job seekers, helping readers improve their applications and mindset.
- **Who is the target audience?**
  - Job seekers (students, career changers, early-career professionals), especially those interested in AI/tech fields.

---

Step 2: Turn the user input into a post wireframe

- [Hook]: Strong, curiosity-sparking line about common resume myths keeping people from landing jobs.
- [The meat]: List the 5 myths and, for each, a short counter/explanation focused on actionable advice.
- [CTA/Question]: “Which of these myths tripped you up the most?” (Pick a single, focused question.)

---

Step 3: Write the body (“meat”)

1. **More is better**
   - A dense 2-page resume won’t impress: clarity and relevance matter most.
2. **I don’t need to tailor my resume**
   - Employers look for fit. You need to show, not hope, you’re right for this job.
3. **I need an objective statement**
   - Nine times out of ten, these are generic and waste precious space. Focus on skills and achievements.
4. **Writing down my experience is enough**
   - List what you achieved—not just what you did. Impact beats responsibilities.
5. **I don’t need a portfolio**
   - Even for non-creatives, a simple portfolio (a single project/demo) helps you stand out.

---

Step 4: Write the CTA or question

Which of these myths tripped you up the most?

---

Step 5: Hook brainstorming

Step 5A: Brainstorm labeled directions:

- [User’s own phrasing] “5 Resume Myths That Kept Me Unemployed”
- [Problem/solution] “Why your resume probably isn’t working—and how to fix it”
- [Personal story] “I fell for these resume myths and it cost me months of job searching…”
- [Trend/urgency] “Most applicants still believe #3—but it guarantees your resume won’t be read”
- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “Think you know what makes a great resume? You might be falling for these myths”

Step 5B: Add notes to each

- [User’s own phrasing] Direct, clear—lists the exact topic; points to “unemployed” result.
- [Problem/solution] Implies most resumes fail, promises tips—inviting curiosity.
- [Personal story] Slightly more vulnerable, but unless Shaw has been unemployed/willing to share that, best to avoid making up details; could make it “I see these myths everywhere.”
- [Trend/urgency] “Most applicants” creates FOMO; pointing out one specific (“#3”) piques curiosity.
- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] Inviting the audience to “test” their assumptions about resumes; good for engagement.

Step 5C: Choose and write

I’ll use a slight hybrid to best fit Shaw’s voice and the user’s input: direct, valuable, and curiosity-sparking.

5 resume myths that quietly sabotage your job search.

After reviewing hundreds of applications (and making my own mistakes early on), these common beliefs keep popping up:

1. **More is better**  
A dense 2-page resume isn’t impressive—clarity and relevance win every time.

2. **I don’t need to tailor my resume**  
Employers want proof you’re the right fit. Generic resumes get ignored.

3. **I need an objective statement**  
Most are generic fluff. Use that space to highlight skills and real achievements.

4. **Writing down my experience is enough**  
Listing tasks doesn’t cut it—show your impact and results.

5. **I don’t need a portfolio**  
Even a basic project site can give you a huge edge, especially in tech.

A dense 2-page resume isn’t impressive—clarity and relevance win every time.

2. **I don’t need to tailor my resume**  
Employers want proof you’re the right fit. Generic resumes get ignored.

3. **I need an objective statement**  
Most are generic fluff. Use that space to highlight skills and real achievements.

4. **Writing down my experience is enough**  
Listing tasks doesn’t cut it—show your impact and results.

5. **I don’t need a portfolio**  
Even a basic project site can give you a huge edge, especially in tech.

Which of these myths tripped you up the most?"
• 3 LLM use cases (that are not a chatbot) ◦ But how do I actually use ai—3 real world use cases ◦ Lead scoring ◦ Lead (unsupervised) clustering. Customer segmentation ◦ LI post writer (FT an LLM to write LI posts) ◦ LI post scoring ◦ Concept math?,"Step 1: Purpose & Audience  
- Purpose: Educate (give practical, real-world use cases for LLMs that go beyond chatbots and show how AI can be directly useful)  
- Audience: Broadly technical professionals, founders, marketers, solo entrepreneurs—especially those curious about ""how do I actually use AI/LLMs?"" in areas like sales, marketing, and content

Step 2: Wireframe  
[Engaging hook: Surface the reader’s curiosity about *actual*, non-chatbot LLM use cases.]
[Body: Brief explanation—most think chat, but LLMs are more useful than that. List and briefly describe 3 real-world, non-chatbot use cases: (1) lead scoring, (2) customer segmentation (via unsupervised clustering), (3) LinkedIn post scoring/writing. Possibly drop the “concept math” since it doesn’t fully fit, unless I can phrase it as a practical use case.]  
[CTA: “What other practical uses for LLMs would you add?”]

Step 3: Body  
Most people default to using LLMs as smart chatbots. But there are at least three ways I see LLMs being applied right now that have nothing to do with chat:

1. **Lead Scoring**  
Feed your sales leads into an LLM, along with your definition of an “ideal customer.” The model can analyze lead details and prioritize the best ones for outreach—much faster than manual reviews.

2. **Customer Segmentation (Unsupervised Clustering)**  
LLMs can automatically group (cluster) your customers based on their behaviors, needs, or other data—giving you unique segments for targeted marketing, product offers, etc.

3. **LinkedIn Post Generator/Scorer**  
You can fine-tune (or prompt) an LLM to write LinkedIn posts in your own style, or even score/analyze your posts to see what’s likely to perform best.

Step 4: CTA  
What’s the most useful non-chatbot LLM use case you’ve seen?

Step 5: Hook (brainstorm directions)  
Step 5A: Brainstorm labeled directions—  
- [Problem/Solution] “Stuck on chatbot ideas? Here’s how LLMs are actually useful in business.”
- [Beginner-to-Expert Clarity] “Most people only use LLMs as chatbots. Here are 3 better ways.”
- [Numbered List] “3 Real-World Ways to Use LLMs (That Aren’t Chatbots!)”
- [Relatable question] “Ever wonder what LLMs can actually do—besides chat?”
- [User’s own phrasing] “But how do I actually use AI—3 real-world use cases”

Step 5B: Add short notes—  
- [Problem/Solution] Many companies are stuck on chatbot use cases. Here are concrete business applications.
- [Beginner-to-Expert Clarity] Most people overlook these more valuable ways to use LLMs.
- [Numbered List] Easy scan, clear promise—lists “3” new use cases.
- [Relatable question] Invites the audience’s curiosity and their pain with superficial chat demos.
- [User’s own phrasing] Very direct, plain language.

Step 5C: Choose hook—  
I think the “Numbered List” with a quick problem/solution will attract the right crowd.  
Final hook:  
“Most people use LLMs for chatbots. But the real magic happens when you go beyond that.  
Here are 3 real-world LLM use cases you can use right now (no chatbots required):”

Step 6: Draft the full post

Most people use LLMs for chatbots. But the real magic happens when you go beyond that.

Here are 3 real-world LLM use cases you can use right now (no chatbots required):

1. **Lead Scoring**  
Let an LLM analyze your incoming leads against your “ideal customer” criteria and rank the best prospects instantly.

2. **Customer Segmentation (Unsupervised Clustering)**  
Use LLMs to bucket customers into sharp segments based on their behavior, interests, or needs—no manual tagging required.

3. **LinkedIn Post Writer/Scorer**  
Fine-tune an LLM to write LinkedIn posts in your tone, or have it score and rate your posts so you know which ones are likely to perform best.

LLMs are great for chat—but they’re even better as “under-the-hood” engines for real business workflows.

What’s the most useful non-chatbot LLM use case you’ve seen?

Step 7: Review for style, voice, flow  
- No repeated em dashes
- Lists and whitespace for scanning
- Direct, conversational tone
- Clear, practical, Sharp
- CTA is singular and actionable
- Hook uses “most people”—relatable, direct

What is data quality? Accuracy and diversity.,"Step 1: Purpose & Audience
- What is the purpose of this post?  
  Educate—explaining what ""data quality"" means in the context of AI, ML, or data-driven projects.
- Who is the target audience?  
  Broad audience: AI practitioners, data scientists, and anyone working with or learning about data.

Step 2: Post Wireframe
- Hook (short, above the fold): A strong statement or question about data quality.
- Body: Explain the two key pillars—accuracy and diversity—of data quality. Keep it accessible and actionable.
- CTA: Invite the audience to add their thoughts or examples.

Step 3: Body/Meat
Everyone talks about ""data quality"" in AI and machine learning, but what does it actually mean?  
At its core, data quality boils down to two things:
- **Accuracy:** How correct and reliable is your data? If your source is flawed, every model or analysis downstream will be too.
- **Diversity:** Does your data represent the full spectrum of the problem? If your data only covers a narrow range, your solutions will have blind spots.

Both matter—ignore one, and you risk misleading insights or biased AI.

Step 4: CTA/Question
What’s the most overlooked aspect of data quality in your experience?

Step 5: Hook Brainstorm

Step 5A: Labeled directions
- [User phrasing] What is data quality? Accuracy and diversity.
- [Problem/solution] “Most people think data quality is just about accuracy—here’s what’s missing.”
- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “You can have ‘spotless’ data and still fail. Here’s why diversity matters.”
- [Trend/urgency] “AI breaks when your data misses this second ingredient.”
- [Practical tip] “If you only optimize for accuracy, you’re missing half the picture in data.”

Step 5B: Short notes
- [User phrasing] Direct, simple, gets to the point.
- [Problem/solution] Many ignore diversity, overlooking bias and representation.
- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “Clean"" isn’t enough if it’s not representative.
- [Trend/urgency] Models are more biased than ever if trained on narrow data.
- [Practical tip] Double-check both accuracy and diversity before building.

Step 5C: Choose Direction and Final Hook
Let’s go with the “problem/solution” angle—most people talk about accuracy, but diversity is just as critical.

Final Hook:  
Most people think “data quality” just means accuracy—but that’s only half the story.

Step 6: Full Post Draft

Most people think “data quality” just means accuracy—but that’s only half the story.

Whenever people talk about data quality in AI or machine learning projects, two pillars matter most:
- **Accuracy:** Is your data correct and trustworthy? If it’s not, every decision or prediction you make downstream inherits those errors.
- **Diversity:** Does your data really capture the full range of your use case? A narrow dataset can lead to blind spots, bias, and brittle results.

Ignore either one, and your models will mislead you—often when you least expect it.

What’s the most overlooked aspect of data quality in your experience?

Step 7: Review (Checklist)
- One em dash (kept for voice near end)
- Language is not repeated in hook/first lines
- No assumption of personal projects/results
- Bulleted structure for clarity
- Conversational tone, invites engagement
- No description of specific external sources
- Final line is ONE clear CTA

Step 8: Final Post
