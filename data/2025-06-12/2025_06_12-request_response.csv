"5 ways to make money with your AI skills 
- get a job 
- implementation 
- strategy/consulting 
- education
- product","Step 1: Purpose & Audience  
- **Purpose**: Educate and validate interest in content (money-making with AI skills), potentially tease upcoming deeper content.  
- **Target Audience**: Aspiring AI freelancers, developers, and creators looking to monetize their skills; possibly Shaw’s broader audience interested in practical AI careers.

---

Step 2: Post Wireframe  
- Hook: (above the fold) Tease “5 ways,” prompt reflection (“How are you using your skills?”)
- Meat: Quick breakdown of the 5 ways, briefly explaining each (with value/action in each point)
- CTA: “Which one are you focusing on?” (single, focused question)

---

Step 3: Write the Meat

Let’s briefly break down each way Shaw-style—helpful, clear, action-focused.

```
There’s more than one path to getting paid in the AI space. Here are the 5 I see most often:

1. **Land a Job**  
  - Join a company building with AI. Stable income, learn while you earn.

2. **Implementation**  
  - Build or integrate solutions for businesses. Direct, practical—think automation, custom tools, proof of concepts.

3. **Strategy/Consulting**  
  - Guide teams on *how* they should use AI. Less about code, more about vision, frameworks, and roadmaps.

4. **Education**  
  - Teach others—through content, workshops, or training. If you can explain it, you can monetize it.

5. **Product**  
  - Create your own tool, agent, or resource. Harder upfront, but highest leverage if you get it right.

Personally, I’ve dabbled in all 5. Each comes with its own learning curve (and upside).
```

---

Step 4: Write the CTA or Question

Pick one focused CTA:  
- “Which path are you most interested in exploring?”

---

Step 5: Write the Hook (after brainstorming directions)

**Step 5A: Brainstorm 3–5 directions for the hook**

1. [Problem/solution]: “Stuck on how to actually earn with AI skills? Here are 5 concrete options (and why each works).”
2. [Beginner-to-expert clarity]: “Most people think ‘get a job’ is the only way to make money with AI—but there are 5 proven paths.”
3. [Personal story]: “When I started, I only saw one way to monetize my AI skills. Here’s what I wish I knew.”
4. [Numbers/results]: “5 ways I’ve personally made money with AI—ranked from beginner to advanced.”
5. [Challenge/engagement]: “How are you actually turning AI skills into income? These are the 5 main routes I see working right now.”

**Step 5B: Add notes**

1. [Problem/solution]—strong for those stuck (“How do I actually get paid doing this?”)
2. [Beginner-to-expert]—unlocks alternatives, good for those needing clarity
3. [Personal story]—shows Shaw’s evolution, empathy
4. [Numbers/results]—strong social proof, “I’ve done these”
5. [Challenge/engagement]—involvement from the first line

**Step 5C: Choose one and write the hook**

Let’s combine #2 and #4 for credibility and clarity:  
“Most people think a 9–5 is the only way to get paid in AI. I’ve found 5 (and tried all of them).”

"AI principles I know at 29, I wish I had known at 24.
- Don't use AI
- Focus on problems not tech
- Spend more time on data curation
- Data quality > data quantity
- Run experiments","**Step 1: Purpose & Audience**

- Purpose: Educate + reflective lesson sharing; possibly resonate with younger technologists/entrepreneurs and help them avoid common pitfalls.
- Target audience: Early-career technologists, AI entrepreneurs, aspiring builders (age 20–30), maybe former self.

---

**Step 2: Wireframe**

- Hook: Lessons I wish I’d known earlier / hard-won AI truths no one told me at 24
- Body:
    - List-style, 5 key principles
    - Reflection on why each matters, what mistake it corrects
    - Tie-in to growth since 24
- CTA: What’s one principle you wish you knew sooner? (Focused question inviting audience reflection/sharing.)

---

**Step 3: Write the Body (“Meat”)**

Here are 5 AI principles I’ve learned the hard way, and why I wish I had embraced them earlier:

1. **Don’t use AI** (just for the sake of it).
   If you make AI your hammer, every problem starts to look like a nail. Most problems don’t actually need machine learning, let alone deep learning. Simpler solutions win more often than you’d think.

2. **Focus on problems, not tech.**
   The tech is cool. But the biggest wins come when you get obsessed with understanding the problem—not with maximizing model complexity.

3. **Spend more time on data curation.**
   We all want to jump to building models, but the best results I’ve seen come from obsessively cleaning, labeling, and organizing data. Boring? Sometimes. But it moves the needle.

4. **Data quality > data quantity.**
   Give me 1,000 excellent, well-understood examples over 10 million random rows any day. You can’t out-engineer bad data.

5. **Run experiments.**
   Don’t theorize forever. Ship quick, measure, and learn. Most of my progress came from launching imperfect things, then iterating.

If I could go back and tell my 24-year-old self just these 5 things, I would have saved a lot of time (and built better stuff, faster).

---

**Step 4: CTA/Question**

What’s one principle you wish you knew sooner?

---

**Step 5A: Brainstorm Hook Directions**

1. [Personal reflection] “AI things I wish I knew 5 years earlier”
2. [Problem/solution] “Why most AI projects fail before they start”
3. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “The first advice I give every new AI builder”
4. [Mistakes/failure] “What I got painfully wrong about AI in my twenties”

---

**Step 5B: Add notes to each**

1. [Personal reflection] “I started building AI projects at 24—by 29, here’s what I actually learned that changed everything”
2. [Problem/solution] “More AI doesn’t always mean better results—most builders trip up before they write a line of code”
3. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “Forget complex models—the real lever is always your data and process”
4. [Mistakes/failure] “Had to unlearn a lot of AI hype—wish someone had told me to focus on data, not headlines”

---

**Step 5C: Pick strongest and write hook**

Choosing [Personal reflection] because it’s relatable, humble, and honest.

**Final hook:**
If I could give my 24-year-old self just 5 principles about building with AI, here’s what I’d say.

---

**Step 6: Review for style, sequence, and voice**

- Conversational, honest, concise;
- Bulleted, scannable;
- Reflection-oriented, not preachy;
- Clear CTA for engagement.

---

**Step 7: Final Post**

---

If I could give my 24-year-old self just 5 principles about building with AI, here’s what I’d say:

1. **Don’t use AI (just for the sake of it).**  
   If AI is your hammer, every problem looks like a nail. Most don’t need machine learning at all—simpler solutions work more often than you think.

2. **Focus on problems, not tech.**  
   The true wins come from deeply understanding the problem, not from stacking the latest hot models.

3. **Spend more time on data curation.**  
   Best results show up when you obsess over clean, organized, well-labeled data. Models are only as good as what you feed them.

4. **Data quality > data quantity.**  
   I’ll take 1,000 excellent examples over a million noisy ones. You can’t code your way out of bad data.

5. **Run experiments.**  
   Don’t speculate forever—ship, measure, learn, repeat. My biggest leaps came from launching imperfect things and iterating.

If I’d known just these five, I would’ve saved myself years of false starts.

"Most top AI engineers aren’t more intelligent than you.
They just do this one thing more… BUILD","Let's walk through the process step-by-step, following the 7-step structure.

---

**Step 1: Purpose & Audience**

- **Purpose:** Motivate and inspire readers to take initiative in learning AI by “building,” not just consuming theory. (Education, mindset shift)
- **Target audience:** Aspiring AI engineers, solopreneurs, techies intimidated by “top AI talent,” self-taught learners.

---

**Step 2: Wireframe**

```
[Hook: Top AI engineers aren't necessarily smarter—they just build more.]

[Body:
- Honest explanation: most AI ""rockstars"" get ahead by building, not IQ.
- Why building matters (iteration, real-world skill, feedback, serendipity).
- Personal note: I wasn’t an AI prodigy, but shipped projects constantly.
- Tactics or nudge: start small—clone a simple agent, automate a boring task.]

[CTA: What's one small AI project you could start this week?]
```

---

**Step 3: Body (“Meat”)**

It’s easy to assume that the best AI engineers are just the smartest in the room. But in my experience, the real separator is that they simply build more.

Every project ships a new skill, not just knowledge.  
You get instant feedback, clarity around what you don’t know, and sometimes, unexpected new ideas.

When I started in AI, I wasn’t the “gifted” coder. I just kept tinkering—shipping quick-and-dirty tools, simple agents, automations for my freelancing work. Over time, tiny projects stacked up into real confidence—and eventually, income.

If you’re feeling behind, don’t chase the perfect course or wait until you “know enough.”  
Start with a simple build. Even automating a daily routine can teach you more than a week of tutorials.

---

**Step 4: CTA**

What’s one small AI project you could start this week?

---

**Step 5: Hook**

5A: Label 3-5 hook directions

1. [Problem/Solution] - “Most top AI engineers aren’t smarter; they just build more.”
2. [Personal Story] - “I wasn’t the most gifted AI coder—but I shipped more projects.”
3. [Beginner-to-expert] - “Don’t wait to be ‘ready’—start building and watch what happens.”
4. [Controversial/Pattern Break] - “AI ‘genius’ is overrated. Here’s what really matters.”
5. [Challenge] - “Want to stand out in AI? Build, don’t just learn.”

5B: Notes

- ""A lot of people assume there's a 'gifted' type—but it’s habit.""
- “I learned more from projects than from any course.”
- “Building > IQ.”
- Could use a quote or reference to real builders.

5C: Choose the hook direction and write the final hook

Let’s go with direction 1, mixing with a little controversy:

Most top AI engineers aren’t more intelligent than you—  
They just build more.

---

**Step 6: Review for style, sequence, and voice**

- Clean structure; clear, plain language.
- Humble personal mention.
- Tactics (“start small; automate a boring task”) make it actionable.
- Invites comment, focused question at end.

---

**Step 7: Final Post**

---

Most top AI engineers aren’t more intelligent than you—  
They just build more.

It’s easy to assume the “best” AI folks are simply geniuses. But the real game-changer? Shipping projects.

Every build teaches you something a course can’t:
- Instant feedback
- Real-world skills
- Surprising new insights

I wasn’t a natural AI coder—but I kept tinkering. Quick tools, tiny automations, little agents for my own workflow. Over time, those projects stacked up into real confidence (and eventually, actual income).

Don’t wait until you “know enough” to start. Even automating a single boring task will teach you more than a week of theory.

"7 LLM use cases (have helped me avoid hiring people as a solopreneur)
coding assistant
Going from 0 to 1 on a new topic
Writing copy
Email outreach scripts
ICP refinement
Podcasts into blogs
Creating peer groups for course","**Step 1: Purpose & Target Audience**
- **Purpose:** Educate and validate the idea that LLMs can seriously extend a solopreneur’s capabilities (and save hiring costs).
- **Target Audience:** Solopreneurs, indie hackers, freelancers, and entrepreneurs who want to stay lean or are early in their journey.

```

---

**Step 3: Meat of the Post**
I’ve avoided hiring people for these roles—because smarter LLM workflows now handle them for me:

1. **Coding assistant:** Debugs, writes snippets, and explains unfamiliar libraries so I can ship faster.
2. **Going 0→1 on new topics:** Need to learn what I don’t know? LLMs structure roadmaps or summarize research in minutes.
3. **Writing copy:** Landing pages, emails, headlines—drafted and tweaked via prompts.
4. **Email outreach scripts:** Warms up cold intros with personalized, relevant templates.
5. **ICP refinement:** Iterates on my ideal customer profile based on feedback, data, and market angles.
6. **Podcasts → blogs:** Turns a 1-hour episode into a readable, ranked article draft.

My Journey from 0 to 70k (key lessons),"**Step 1: Purpose & Audience**  
- Purpose: Share and validate Shaw’s entrepreneurial journey milestone; share key lessons; inspire and educate others on a similar path  
- Audience: Fellow entrepreneurs, aspiring solopreneurs, and those building a business in AI/tech; Shaw’s LinkedIn following (mix of tech professionals and early founders)  

**Step 2: Wireframe**  
- Hook: Tease the “0 to $70k” journey, hint at personal/critical lessons learned  
- Body: Brief context (0->$70k journey timeframe & setting), list of 3-5 key lessons, maybe a personal anecdote  
- CTA: What’s your biggest lesson from your journey?  

**Step 3: Write the Body (“meat”)**  

A year ago, I was starting at $0 as a solopreneur—no audience, no safety net, and no real sense of how to turn my skills into a business.  
Today, I’ve crossed $70,000 in revenue, building with AI, sharing what I learn, and helping others along the way.  
Here’s what I wish I knew at the start:  
1. **Start before you’re ready.** You’ll never feel “qualified” enough—the best validation comes from shipping and testing ideas in public.  
2. **Teach everything you learn.** Explaining concepts (even as a beginner) brought me clients, collaborations, and unexpected opportunities.  
3. **Build in small bets.** I launched micro-projects, not big launches. Most flopped, but a few turned into real income streams.  
4. **Keep your expenses lean.** Early revenue is precious—don’t burn it all on tools, ads, or courses.  
5. **Share your numbers and failures.** Honesty builds trust and attracts your real community.  
None of this is rocket science, but consistency is 90% of the game.  

**Step 4: CTA or question**  
What’s the most valuable lesson you’ve learned on your own journey?  

**Step 5: Hook (and direction brainstorm)**  
*5A: Brainstorm directions for the hook:*  
- [Milestone/Results] “How I went from $0 to $70k as a solo founder—in a year.”  
- [Problem/solution] “Nobody tells you about the messy middle between $0 and $70k…”  
- [Personal story] “A year ago, I was stuck at zero. What changed?”  
- [Trend/relatability] “The hardest part of growing solo: making the first $70k stick.”  
- [Myth-busting] “You don’t need a big audience or funding to reach $70k (Here’s what worked).”  

*5B: Short notes to each:*  
- [Milestone/Results] — Make it concrete & specific, appeals to those wanting proof/blueprint  
- [Problem/solution] — The “messy middle” as an overlooked pain; everyone hears about $0 or $1M  
- [Personal story] — Sets up a humble, vulnerable tone; pulling in from real self-doubt  
- [Trend/relatability] — Solo journey, not just “startup success”  
- [Myth-busting] — Underdog angle; relatable and practical  

*5C: Pick the best direction and write the hook*  
Let’s choose the [Milestone/Results] with a hint of honesty:  
How I went from $0 to $70k as a solo founder—and what I wish I knew earlier.  

**Step 6: Review for Style, Sequence, and Voice**  
- Personal, honest, numbers up front  
- Brief, scannable lessons  
- Ends with a single question inviting community insights  
- Feels like a “mentor/friend” debrief, not “guru”  

**Step 7: Write the Final Post**

How I went from $0 to $70k as a solo founder—and what I wish I knew earlier.

A year ago, I was starting at zero. No audience, no safety net, and honestly, no idea if turning my skills into a business would work.

Now, after crossing $70,000 in revenue (teaching, building, and sharing everything I learn with AI), I can see a few things that made all the difference:

1. **Start before you’re ready.** You’ll never feel “qualified.” Ship projects and test ideas in public.
2. **Teach everything you learn.** Explaining even simple concepts drew in clients, collaborations, and new friendships.
3. **Bet small, learn fast.** Most of my micro-projects flopped, but a few became real income streams.
4. **Keep expenses lean.** Early dollars matter. Fancy tools and ads can wait.
5. **Share numbers and failures.** Transparency builds trust—and your real community finds you.

No secrets, just consistent steps—every week, even when it felt slow.

   Automatically tag and organize your emails to declutter and save focus.

No heavy math, no complex setup—just hands-on tools you’ll actually use.

Which one are you most excited to try?"
50k subs YouTube milestone,"**Step 1: Purpose & Audience**

- **Purpose**: Celebrate a milestone, show gratitude, and validate journey; lightly promote Shaw’s channel and community.  
- **Audience**: Shaw’s LinkedIn network—current subscribers, peers, potential followers/students, and fellow creators.

---

**Step 2: Wireframe**

```
[Engaging hook about the milestone, personal journey, or unexpected lesson]

[Share the 50k YouTube sub milestone, quick reflection on journey, key lesson or surprise, gratitude for support, maybe a quick example/result or behind-the-scenes]

[CTA: Ask what kinds of videos (or topics) people want to see next]
```

---

**Step 3: Write the Body**

It honestly still feels surreal:
50,000 subscribers on YouTube.  
That’s 50,000 people who care about learning AI, building cool projects, and growing online with me.

I started making videos as a way to explain things simply—mostly to clarify them for myself. My first upload got maybe 12 views (and I’m certain half were from my mom).  
Now, I get thoughtful questions from entrepreneurs, students, and developers all over the world. We’ve covered everything from building scrappy GPT-4 tools to pricing your first freelance gig to streamlining content workflows.

It’s been:
- A lot of trial and (sometimes cringe) error  
- Many “Why am I even doing this?” moments  
- More value—and real connections—than I ever expected

Thank you to everyone who’s watched, commented, or just lurked quietly in the background. None of this happens without you.

**Step 4: CTA**

What do you want me to teach or build next?

---

**Step 5: Hook Brainstorming**

**Step 5A:** Labeled Directions  
1. [Personal Journey] “I never thought I’d hit this milestone, but…”  
2. [Numbers/Results] “50,000+ people. One scrappy YouTube channel.”  
3. [Gratitude] “Thank you, to every single subscriber.”  
4. [Behind-the-scenes surprise] “My first upload: 12 views. Today: 50,000 subscribers.”  
5. [Problem/Solution] “Struggling with imposter syndrome? I was, until…”  

**Step 5B:** Key Phrases  
1. [Personal Journey] “Started with zero, learned as I went, still figuring it out.”  
2. [Numbers/Results] “From 12 views to 50,000 subs”  
3. [Gratitude] “Couldn’t do this without you.”  
4. [Behind-the-scenes] “Thought about quitting, but kept sharing anyway.”  
5. [Imposter syndrome] “Videos weren’t perfect, but they helped others.”

**Step 5C:** Choose Strongest Direction & Write Hook

Let’s go with [Behind-the-scenes surprise], since it’s humble and relatable:

**Final Hook:**

My first YouTube video got 12 views.
Today, this channel just crossed 50,000 subscribers.

---

**Step 6: Review for Style, Sequence, and Voice**

- Conversational and direct  
- Real numbers and small “failures”  
- Clear gratitude  
- Invitation to interact

My first YouTube video got 12 views.  
Today, this channel just crossed 50,000 subscribers.

It honestly still feels surreal:
That’s 50,000 people who care about learning AI, building cool projects, and growing online with me.

I started making videos just to explain things simply—mainly for myself. My first upload? Maybe 12 views (and I’m pretty sure half were from my mom).

Now, people from all over the world are building projects, starting businesses, and kickstarting side hustles from what we’ve covered—everything from scrappy GPT-4 tools to honest freelancer pricing.

The real secret?  
- I made a ton of mistakes (and kept sharing anyway)  
- I hit “publish” when something was still half-baked  
- I learned more from the comments than from expert guides

Thank you to everyone who watched, commented, or even just lurked in the background. None of this happens without your support.

"Reminder: being rich isn’t about what’s in you bank account, but what’s in your mind… keep learning","**Step 1: Purpose & Audience**  
- **Purpose:** Inspire continual self-education and a growth mindset. Validate Shaw’s ethos around lifelong learning (content validation/posture).
- **Audience:** Broad: solopreneurs, entrepreneurs, growth-minded professionals, anyone in Shaw’s extended network focused on personal/professional growth.

---

**Step 2: Wireframe Breakdown**  
- Hook: Challenge a common assumption about richness/wealth.
- Meat: Share Shaw’s perspective that wealth is mental, not just monetary; illustrate why a learning mindset pays the best dividends.
- CTA: Single focused question—invite readers to share what they’re learning.

---

**Step 3: Post Body (Meat)**  
When I started my entrepreneurial journey, I was laser-focused on building up my bank account.  
But somewhere along the way, I realized: financial wealth fades if you stop reinvesting in your mind.

The skills I learned, the books I read, and the projects I tried (and failed at) are still paying me returns—years later.

Money can disappear. But knowledge compounds.

Every course, every experiment, every conversation with smart, curious people?  
That’s real wealth. And the good news: you don’t need anyone’s permission to grow it.

---

**Step 4: CTA / Question**  
What’s one thing you’re learning right now that you wish you’d discovered sooner?

**Step 5: Hook (Using Step-by-step Reasoning)**

**Step 5A: Brainstorming Hook Directions**
- [Problem/Solution] “Most people chase money, but overlook the true currency for growth.”
- [Personal story] “My bank account was growing, but my mindset was stuck.”
- [Results/Outcomes] “Knowledge pays me bigger dividends than my investments ever did.”
- [Trend/Urgency] “The fastest way to go broke? Stop learning.”
- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “Being rich isn’t about your net worth—it’s about your knowledge.”

**Step 5B: Notes for Directions**
- [Problem/Solution] Many focus on financial gain, neglect the compounding benefit of mindset/skills.
- [Personal story] Realization after years in the grind; illustration of lessons greater than bank balance.
- [Results] Emphasize compounding, even if the “number” isn’t monetary.
- [Trend/Urgency] Subversive advice, warning about the stagnation trap.
- [Beginner-expert] Reframing common concept.

**Step 5C: Choose/Write Final Hook**

Final Hook:

"A problem with AI today is that it means different things to different people. Share 3 types of software.

Software 1.0 = Rule-based systems
Software 2.0 = ML
Software 3.0 = LLMs","**Step 1:**  
- *Purpose*: Educate, clarify confusion about what “AI” means, and introduce clear mental models (validate content idea)  
- *Target audience*: Tech-curious LinkedIn audience (builders, founders, professionals who are interested in AI but may get confused by jargon)

**Step 2:**  
**Wireframe:**  
```
[Hook]
[Explain the confusion around ""AI"" and what it can mean]
[Introduce the 3 ""types"" of software and clarify each:]
- Software 1.0 = Rule-based (classic, “if this then that”)
- Software 2.0 = Machine Learning (data-driven)
- Software 3.0 = LLMs (language as a platform)
[Brief example or clarification for each; why the difference matters]
[Conclude with CTA: ""Which type do you work with most?"" or ""What’s your definition of AI?""]
```

**Step 3:**  
**Body draft:**  
If you ask 10 people what “AI” means, you’ll get 10 totally different answers.  
Here’s a clearer model I like:  
- **Software 1.0 = Rule-based**  
  Classic programming: if-this-then-that. Everything is hand-coded by humans. Used for things like spreadsheets, web apps, embedded devices.
- **Software 2.0 = Machine Learning**  
  Instead of coding every rule, you feed lots of data and train a model to predict outcomes. This powers things like image recognition and credit scoring.
- **Software 3.0 = LLMs (Large Language Models)**  
  Instead of hand-crafting data features, you pretrain a giant model on massive text, then fine-tune or prompt it. LLMs can reason, generate text, and act as agents. Examples: ChatGPT, Claude, etc.

Why does this matter?  
Because when someone says “AI,” they might be talking about entirely different types of software—each with unique strengths, weaknesses, and risks.

**Step 4:**  
**CTA:**  
Which “version” of software do you work with most?

**Step 5:**  
**Hook brainstorming:**
- [Problem/solution] “Everyone talks about ‘AI’, but almost no one means the same thing.”
- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “There are really 3 kinds of ‘AI’ software. Most people lump them all together.”
- [Results/outcomes] “How we got from rule-based code to ChatGPT—and why it matters.”
- [Personal story] “It took me years to realize: when most people say ‘AI,’ they’re usually talking about three totally different things.”
- [Trend/urgency] “AI in 2024 means something new—are you using Software 1.0, 2.0, or 3.0?”

**Step 5B:**  
- [Problem/solution] “Everyone uses ‘AI’—but almost everyone is talking about something totally different. Here’s a mental model you can use to sort the confusion.”
- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “Let’s untangle the AI mess. Here’s a 3-level cheat sheet.”
- [Results] “From ‘if-then’ to ChatGPT. The 3 stages of AI software.”

**Step 5C:**  
Best angle: [Beginner-to-expert clarity] → Bold promise: untangle the confusion.

**Draft Hook:**  
If “AI” conversations feel confusing, you’re not alone.  
There are really *three* kinds of software people call “AI”—and most folks mix them up.

**Step 6:**  
- Check voice: Technical mentor, approachable. Clarity > jargon.  
- Sequence: Hook → problem → framework → clear, simple examples → value → question  
- One CTA, plain language, structural clarity.

---

**Step 7: Final Post**

---

If “AI” conversations feel confusing, you’re not alone.

There are actually *three* kinds of software people call “AI”—and most folks mix them up:

- **Software 1.0 = Rule-based systems**  
  Classic “if this, then that.” Humans write all the logic. Think: spreadsheets, calculators, web forms.

- **Software 2.0 = Machine Learning**  
  Your code learns from data. You feed it examples, it finds patterns. That’s how we got better spam filters, image recognition, and tons of business analytics.

- **Software 3.0 = LLMs (Large Language Models)**  
  Now, the software “learns” by pretraining on a huge chunk of the internet, then you steer it with prompts or small tweaks. Think ChatGPT, Claude, and text-to-anything tools.

Why does this matter? Because when someone says “AI,” they might mean any of these—each with very different strengths, risks, and applications.

"3 communication tips for data scientists.
use stories
Use examples
Use analogies","Step 1: Purpose and Audience  
- Purpose: Educate; share actionable tips to help data scientists communicate their work more effectively.
- Audience: Data scientists (especially those early in their career), technical professionals transitioning into more collaborative or external-facing roles.

Step 2: Wireframe  
- Hook: Something calling out poor communication as a bottleneck or offering ways to stand out as a more effective data scientist.
- Meat:
    - State the challenge (technical people being misunderstood).
    - Share three methods:
        1. Use stories  
        2. Use examples  
        3. Use analogies
    - Brief description for each, real and actionable.
- CTA: Prompt to share their favorite communication technique.

Step 3: Meat of the Post  

Most data scientists I know struggle to make non-technical teammates *actually* get why their work matters.

Here are 3 methods I use to bridge the gap:

1. **Tell stories:**  
    Start with a real-world customer scenario, not just data points. This helps ground your insights in something your audience can relate to.

2. **Share examples:**  
    Don’t just talk about algorithms—show what they do. A screenshot, a short demo, or a “before and after” goes a long way.

3. **Lean on analogies:**  
    Comparing a recommendation engine to a “digital personal shopper” makes it stick—especially for people outside data.

You don’t have to sacrifice technical depth. But if your audience checks out, none of your work will matter.

Step 4: CTA/Question

What’s your #1 tip for explaining technical work simply?

Step 5A: Brainstorm Hook Directions
1. [Problem/Solution] “Most data scientists struggle with being heard by non-technical colleagues.”
2. [Personal Story] “I used to think data spoke for itself—until my work kept getting ignored.”
3. [Beginner-to-Expert Clarity] “Simple language isn’t dumbing things down—it’s smart communication.”
4. [Result/Outcome] “Want your models to get used? Start communicating like THIS.”
5. [Quick Win/List] “3 ways to make your AI projects impossible to ignore”

Step 5B: Add Notes  
1. [Problem/Solution] Many DS folks say “nobody gets it” — Here’s how I fixed it.
2. [Personal Story] Sharing my failure—boss didn’t care until I changed my pitch.
3. [Clarity] The most effective Dsci’s aren’t always the best coders—they’re the best translators.
4. [Result/Outcome] Models never see production because of poor communication—simple fix.
5. [Quick Win/List] Fast, actionable methods to up your comms game.

Step 5C: Pick Best Hook and Write It  
I’ll go with blending Problem/Solution and Personal Story for relatability:

“My biggest breakthroughs as a data scientist didn’t happen in Python—they happened in meetings.”

Step 6: Review for Style, Sequence, and Voice  
- Hook: Clear, slightly unexpected.
- Body: Actionable, specific, conversational.
- CTA: Focused and inviting.

1. **Get hands-on with ChatGPT (or another top language model):**  
   Start playing. Ask questions, generate ideas, summarize articles—you’ll build intuition by seeing what’s possible and what’s missing.

2. **Install Python on your laptop:**  
   You don’t need to be a coder to begin, but Python is the backbone of most AI projects. Play with notebooks (like Google Colab or Jupyter) and solve simple problems.

3. **Build your first automation (Beginner):**  
   Automate something boring in your daily life—a spreadsheet update, email responder, or text summarizer. This gives you a real win and builds immediate confidence.

4. **Level up to a machine learning project (Intermediate):**  
   Train a small model or fine-tune an existing one. Try something tangible—maybe image classification or sentiment analysis with off-the-shelf datasets.

5. **Tackle a real-world project (Advanced):**  
   Build something that solves YOUR problem or helps someone you know. Connect APIs, deploy something live, or set up an agent that actually runs in the background.  
   The real magic happens when you use AI to make your (or someone else’s) life better.

**Step 5: Brainstorm Hooks**

**Step 5A: Label Directions**

- [Problem/solution] Learning AI feels overwhelming—here’s exactly what I’d do from scratch.
- [Personal story] If I lost all my experience, this is how I’d start in 2025.
- [Results/outcomes] The 5 steps I’d use to learn modern AI—no fluff.
- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] Most “AI learning” guides skip these basics.
- [Trend/urgency] AI tools are evolving in 2025; here’s how to actually keep up.

**Step 5B: Add Notes**

- [Problem/solution] Most people bounce off AI because there’s too much noise. Simple path.
- [Personal story] Me, picking up AI in 2025 with zero knowledge.
- [Results] Bite-size steps, *each one is actionable now*.
- [Beginner/expert] “Install Python” still matters; not just prompts and theory.
- [Trend] New tools but old fundamentals.

**Step 5C: Pick Strongest and Write Hook**

Going with “If I lost all my experience, this is how I’d start in 2025”—personal, bold, curiosity-provoking.

---

**Step 6: Review for Style, Sequence, and Voice**

- Is it clear, peer-to-peer, non-hype? ✅
- Is each step actionable? ✅
- Is the CTA singular and focused? ✅

**Step 7: Final Post**

---

**If I lost all my AI experience, here’s exactly how I’d start in 2025:**

If I had to begin from zero, this is the step-by-step path I’d follow:

1. **Get hands-on with ChatGPT (or another top language model):**  
   Just start playing. Ask questions, write summaries, brainstorm ideas. The key is to build intuition by trying it out.

2. **Install Python on your laptop:**  
   You don’t have to become a coder overnight, but Python is the practical glue of most AI projects. Playing with notebooks (Colab or Jupyter) is the fastest way to learn by doing.

3. **Build your first automation (Beginner):**  
   Automate one boring task in your daily life—maybe a spreadsheet update, email responder, or summarizer. It’s motivating to see a real win quickly.

4. **Level up to a machine learning project (Intermediate):**  
   Train a small model or fine-tune an existing one. Try classifying images or running sentiment analysis on text—plenty of datasets are plug-and-play.

5. **Tackle a real-world project (Advanced):**  
   Turn AI loose on a personal problem. Connect APIs, build something that runs in the background, or deploy a simple agent. The key: build for real people, even if that’s just you.

Not everything needs to be perfect or flashy—just keep building, one step at a time.

Customer pain points over your experience and skills
Price for value not time
Higher price tag, longer copy (delay the ask)
Get hyper-clear on avatar then attract them with free content
The diff between $10k and $100k/mo is often business strategy, not tech skills","**Step 1: Purpose & Audience**

- **Purpose:** Share real, actionable lessons learned from a conversation with a successful entrepreneur; validate content ideas around pricing, value, strategy, and audience targeting—educate fellow builders and freelancers.
- **Audience:** Freelancers, early-stage solopreneurs, and other AI builders in Shaw’s network; people aiming to level up their business, pricing, and strategic approach.

**Step 2: Post Wireframe**

- **Hook:** ""I paid a $100k/mo entrepreneur to talk to me… here’s what I learned.""
- **Meat:** 5 key lessons:
    1. Focus on solving customer pain points, not selling your skills or resume.
    2. Price your work based on the value it creates, not the hours it takes.
    3. The higher your price, the more story/context/delay needed before making the ask (long copy).
    4. Get extremely specific about your ideal customer (“avatar”), then attract them with value-first/free content.
    5. The leap from $10k to $100k/month is often about business strategy, not technical skill.
- **CTA:** What lesson would you add?

---

**Step 3: Write the Body**

Last week, I paid a $100k/month entrepreneur just to pick his brain.

Here are 5 raw lessons that hit hardest:

1️⃣ **Pain points > Experience**: Customers don’t care about your fancy skills—they care if you solve their painful problem, fast.

2️⃣ **Value > Time**: Pricing by the hour is a trap. Price according to the value your work creates for the client, not the time you spend.

3️⃣ **Higher price = Longer copy**: Bigger price tags need more context and trust. Don’t ask too soon. Tell the story, show results, and delay “the ask.”

4️⃣ **Get avatar-obsessed**: The more clearly you define your dream client, the more your (free) content attracts them…without chasing.

5️⃣ **Strategy beats skills**: Jumping from $10k to $100k months is almost always about upgrading your business model, not your tech stack.

- [Problem/solution] “Are you stuck at $10k months? Here’s what $100k entrepreneurs know that most miss.”
- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “Your skills aren’t the bottleneck—your business strategy probably is.”
- [Numbers/outcomes] “From $10k/month to $100k/month—the key differences, straight from an expert.”
- [Contrarian] “Most freelancers chase skills—here’s what actually moves the needle.”

5B. **Add notes**
- [Personal story]: Leans on honesty, builds trust—shows I’m still learning/investing.
- [Problem/solution]: Directly speaks to plateaued freelancers/solopreneurs.
- [Beginner-to-expert clarity]: Useful for readers stuck on upskilling.
- [Numbers/outcomes]: Eye-catching for ambitious audience.
- [Contrarian]: Sparks curiosity by flipping assumptions.

- **Purpose:** Share a transparent breakdown of Shaw's first $10k month—offer insights and lessons, validate own credibility, and give actionable info to aspiring entrepreneurs.
- **Target Audience:** Fellow entrepreneurs (especially new/aspiring ones), solo founders, AI freelancers, people looking to make a living online.

[Single CTA: e.g., ""What would you try next?"" or ""What surprised you most about this breakdown?""]
```

---

**Step 3: Meat of the post**

Last month, I crossed $10k in revenue for the first time as an entrepreneur.  
Here’s how it broke down:

- **AI consulting:** $4,200  
  1 client, short-term contract helping build internal AI tools (via LinkedIn referral). Time intensive, high impact.
- **Online course sales:** $2,600  
  From my “AI Agents 101” practical workshop. Mostly driven by my email list and LinkedIn posts—proof that consistent content actually compounds.
- **Freelance dev projects:** $2,300  
  2 smaller projects building chatbots and custom GPT workflows for startups. Most came from past network, not cold outreach.
- **Productized info (Notion templates, small tools):** $950  
  Surprise hit—the lowest effort, but highest profit margin. Mostly Gumroad.

**A few lessons:**  
- Direct outreach didn’t move the needle—everything meaningful came from warm connections or content.  
- Productized offers are way more scalable than 1:1 client work, though they take longer to get off the ground.  
- No “magic” channel—every revenue stream came from months of slow momentum.

This month wasn’t passive income. It was the result of stacking small wins, day after day.

---

**Step 4: CTA**

Which part of this breakdown surprised you most?

---

**Step 5: Hook**

**5A: Brainstorm 3-5 labeled directions**
- [Milestone/Transparency] “Hitting $10k/month: Here’s the real breakdown (no fluff)”
- [Personal story] “This felt impossible a year ago—here’s what finally worked”
- [Common misconception] “Most people think it’s all passive income—here’s my real $10k month”
- [List/Numbers] “4 revenue streams, 1 milestone: My first $10k month dissected”

**5B: Add short notes to each direction**
- [Milestone/Transparency] Leans into honesty, draws in aspiring entrepreneurs.
- [Personal story] Adds relatability, ‘impossible → possible’ transformation.
- [Misconception] Debunks myth, draws in those who have tried/felt stuck.
- [List/Numbers] Clear, curiosity-inducing, shows structure.

**5C: Choose strongest and write the hook**

Let’s pick [Transparency + Numbers], which signals honesty, specifics and credibility:

**Hook:**

---

**Step 6: Review**

- Hook clear, honest, number-driven.
- Body is straightforward, gives real numbers, quick lessons.
- Ends with only ONE CTA: ""Which part of this breakdown surprised you most?""
- Friendly, conversational, no jargon.

Last month, I crossed $10k in revenue for the first time as an entrepreneur.  
Here’s where it came from:

- **AI consulting:** $4,200  
  1 client, short-term contract helping build internal AI tools (via LinkedIn). Time intensive, high impact.

- **Online course sales:** $2,600  
  From my “AI Agents 101” workshop. Mostly from my email list and LinkedIn—proof that consistent content actually compounds.

- **Freelance dev projects:** $2,300  
  2 projects building chatbots and custom GPT workflows. All from my existing network.

- **Productized info (Notion templates, small tools):** $950  
  The surprise hit—lowest effort, highest profit margin. Mostly via Gumroad.

**A few honest lessons:**  
- Warm connections + content > cold outreach (by a landslide)
- Productized offers are more scalable, but slower to start
- Every dollar came from months spent stacking small wins

Managing technical debt when coding with AI. 2 things I consider. 1) my experience with the lang/library and 2) how many times I need to run project.,"**Step 1: Purpose & Audience**
- Purpose: Educate fellow technical builders on how Shaw approaches technical debt when using AI code tools—share practical tips.
- Audience: Technical peers (developers, AI builders, solopreneurs), especially those experimenting with AI in their projects.

[Hook capturing the pain or misconception about AI code + technical debt]

[Tell how I personally weigh technical debt with AI code: 2 criteria. Why they matter. Quick examples/scenarios.]

[Focused question: How do you handle technical debt when moving fast with AI tools?]
```

**Step 3: The Meat (Body of the Post)**
When I’m shipping projects with AI, technical debt is always on my mind—but not all debt is equally painful.

I keep things simple with two questions:
1️⃣ **How well do I know the language or library?**  
If I’m fluent, I’m faster and confident I’ll avoid weird issues later. If not, every shortcut could come back to bite me.

2️⃣ **How many times will I need to run this project?**  
Is this a quick experiment, or is it part of a workflow I’ll launch 100+ times? If it’s just a test, a little messy code is fine. But if it’s going to be production-grade, every hack becomes a landmine.

These two levers help me decide where I can afford debt—and where I need to slow down to pay it upfront.

**Step 4: The CTA/Question**
How do you think about technical debt when building with AI tools?

- [Problem/solution] Many rush with AI code—technical debt piles up.
    - “Most people ignore technical debt when coding with AI. Here’s my 2-part filter.”
- [Personal experience] Admitting mistakes and what now works:
    - “I’ve broken plenty of projects by moving too fast with AI-generated code.”
- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] A lot of people think technical debt doesn’t apply with “throwaway” AI code.
    - “AI code is fast, but technical debt still stings.”
- [Numbers/urgency] “2 simple checks before taking on AI technical debt”
- [Question] “How do you decide when to clean up AI-generated code?”

**Step 5B: Notes**
- Problem/solution: Many people treat code from AI as “cheap”—so they don’t consider cleanup, until it gets messy.
- Personal: Shaw admits to being burned by not managing technical debt, then shifts to the 2-part approach.
- Beginner-to-expert: Sometimes technical debt actually builds up faster with codegen, not slower.

**Step 5C: Select Strongest Direction/Write the Hook**
Best angle: Admit common pain and offer Shaw’s simple filter.

Final Hook:
“AI helps me code fast—but technical debt is always lurking.”

**Step 6: Review**
- Structure: Hook > body (Shaw’s mental framework, explained simply) > single, clear question.
- Voice: Honest, peer-level, rooted in direct experience, focused on actionable insight.

**Step 7: Final Post**

AI helps me code fast—but technical debt is always lurking.

After breaking plenty of projects by moving too quickly, I use a simple 2-question check to manage risk when building with AI:

1️⃣ **How well do I know this language or library?**  
If I’m in familiar territory, shortcuts are safer. In a new stack, every “hack” could cost hours later.

2️⃣ **How many times will I need to run this project?**  
A single-use script? Debt is fine. Part of an automated pipeline? Suddenly, every corner cut becomes a future headache.

These two questions save me from blind spots—helping me decide when to refactor and when to let it slide.

"Share blog: compressing LLMs.

Snippet: While the immense scale of LLMs is responsible for their impressive performance across a wide range of use cases, this presents challenges in their application to real-world problems. In this article, I discuss how we can overcome these challenges by compressing LLMs. I start with a high-level overview of key concepts and then walk through a concrete example with Python code.","**Step-by-step reasoning:**

**Step 1: Purpose & Audience**
- Purpose: Share/tease new blog post and educate about compressing LLMs.
- Audience: Technical peers, AI practitioners, engineers, and those interested in deploying large models in production.

**Step 2: Wireframe**

- Meat: Share what the blog covers and hint at actionable content (high-level overview + code example). Set expectations of clarity and direct utility.
- CTA: Point readers to the blog and/or ask a simple engaging question.

**Step 3: Meat of the Post**
The rapid growth in LLM size has unlocked incredible new capabilities—but it’s also made real-world deployment a real challenge for many teams. In my latest blog post, I break down how model compression can help bridge this gap, starting with a simple overview then diving into a hands-on example with Python code.

Whether you’re shipping AI in production, working on edge devices, or just curious about squeezing more out of your models, you’ll find clear explanations and practical code you can use today.

**Step 4: CTA**
Curious how you’re handling model size and deployment—have you tried compressing LLMs yet? (Or: What’s been your biggest roadblock when deploying LLMs?)

**Step 5A: Brainstorm Hook Directions**
1. [Problem/solution] Struggling to deploy giant LLMs? Here’s a path forward.
2. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] Most LLMs are too big for real-world use—but there’s a fix.
3. [Personal story/EXPLICIT] I run into client roadblocks with LLM size all the time—so I wrote this guide.
4. [Trend/urgency] Model size is the #1 barrier to AI deployment in 2024.
5. [Results/outcomes] Shrinking your LLM can double speed and halve costs (with code).

**Step 5B: Notes for Each Hook Direction**
1. [Problem/solution] “You finally get a giant model working, but then you can’t deploy…”
2. [Beginner-to-expert] “People assume more parameters = better—but not always true in practice.”
3. [Personal story] “Clients keep asking how to make giant models run in production—I needed a go-to resource.”
4. [Trend/urgency] “Tiny models are trending because shipping matters more than benchmarks.”
5. [Results] “What would cutting your model size in half do for your pipeline?”

**Step 5C: Choose the Hook Direction**
Let’s go with direction #2—common misconception plus hope: “LLMs are powerful—but most are far too big to deploy. Here’s how to fix that.”

**Step 6: Review for Style, Sequence, and Voice**
- Clear language, real-world problem, actionable resource.
- Conversational and humble, sets up main value of blog.

Step 3: Write the Body First  

Multimodal LLMs are unlocking new ways to build with AI—they can analyze images, text, and more, all in the same model.

Llama 3.2 Vision is a great example. You can feed it an image and a prompt, and it can answer questions, describe scenes, or even reason about what’s going on visually.

For computer vision projects, this means:
- No complicated pipelines—just hand your image to the LLM.
- Rapid prototyping (object detection, image QA, visual search).
- Combining vision + language for richer apps.

I recorded a quick walkthrough using Llama 3.2 Vision to solve some classic CV tasks. You’ll see:
- How to structure your prompts for visual input
- Sample code/templates
- Where Vision LLMs shine (and where they still stumble)

Step 4: CTA or Question

"Share blog: Local LLM fine-tuning on Mac

Context:
This article is part of a larger series on using large language models (LLMs) in practice. In a previous post, I showed how to fine-tune an LLM using a single (free) GPU on Google Colab. While that example (and many others) readily runs on Nvidia hardware, they are not easily adapted to M-series Macs. In this article, I walk through an easy way to fine-tune an LLM locally on a Mac.","**Step 1: Purpose & Audience**  
- **Purpose:** Share a resource (blog post) + educate (make local LLM fine-tuning more accessible)  
- **Target audience:** Technical builders, indie hackers, AI engineers—especially those using Macs (M1/M2/M3) who want practical, hands-on LLM workflows, plus readers already following the series  

---

**Step 2: Post Wireframe**  
- Hook: Highlight the friction/pain of local LLM tuning on Mac, or tease a solution  
- Meat: Point to series + context (previous Colab/Nvidia example, now filling gap for Macs), overview what’s in the post + why it matters for Mac users  
- CTA: Direct readers to blog, or ask if anyone has tried local LLM fine-tuning on Mac

---

**Step 3: Meat of Post**  
If you’ve tried running large language models locally, you know the “standard” guides usually assume you have access to an Nvidia GPU.

But if you’re on a newer Mac (M1/M2/M3), you hit a wall pretty quickly—the hardware is powerful, but the instructions don’t match.

In my latest article, I show a simple way to fine-tune an LLM *directly on your Mac*.  
This is the next post in my practical LLM series:  
- The last guide showed Colab (free Nvidia GPU)—great, but not truly “local”  
- This time, I walk step-by-step through setting up and running a full fine-tuning workflow on Apple Silicon  
- No exotic libraries, no hacks—just a reliable recipe to get you building with your hardware

If you’re looking to go beyond plug-and-play demos and truly make LLMs yours—this is for you.

---

**Step 4: CTA/Question**  
Direct readers to blog (single CTA):  
Read the full step-by-step guide here: [LINK]

Alternate (question):  
Have you tried fine-tuning LLMs on a Mac? Curious how your experience compares.

For post sharing a blog, direct link CTA is best.

---

**Step 5: The Hook**

**Step 5A: Brainstorm Hook Directions**  
1. [Problem/solution]: “Running LLMs locally on a Mac is a mess—here’s an easier way.”  
2. [Trend/urgency]: “Most LLM guides ignore Macs. Here’s how to cut through the noise.”  
3. [Personal pain/aha]: “It took me hours to make local LLM fine-tuning work on my Mac. Here’s what finally did it.”  
4. [Numbers/series]: “Part 2: From Colab to Mac—LLM fine-tuning anyone can follow.”  
5. [Beginner to expert]: “Think you need Nvidia hardware for LLM fine-tuning? Not anymore.”

**Step 5B: Add Notes**  
1. “Lots of guides are Nvidia only, most don’t explain for Mac.”  
2. “Apple Silicon is everywhere but under-served for LLMs.”  
3. “Personal: Got stuck on dependency hell, found simpler recipe.”  
4. “It’s the next step in my series.”  
5. “Bust the myth—you can use your own Mac.”

**Step 5C: Pick Best and Write Final Hook**  
Strongest is #1 or #5—mythbusting/solving a clear pain.  
Let’s go with #5, simplified/slightly customized:

> Think you need an Nvidia GPU for LLM fine-tuning?  
> Your Mac is more capable than you think.

---

**Step 6: Review for Style & Voice**  
- Clear, plain language  
- Point to specific examples  
- No hype, just solutions  
- Invites readers to explore/learn  
- Clean CTA

---

**Step 7: Write Final Post**

---

```
Think you need an Nvidia GPU for LLM fine-tuning?
Your Mac is more capable than you think.

Most guides for training language models locally ignore Apple Silicon.
So if you’re running an M1, M2, or M3 Mac, you’re left piecing together scattered tips—or just assume it’s impossible.

That’s why I wrote a step-by-step walkthrough for *fine-tuning LLMs directly on your Mac*.
- Builds on my Google Colab guide (Nvidia GPUs), but now: no cloud, no setup headaches
- Covers everything you need to prep your environment, train your model, and actually *use* local compute
- No hacks or dead-end dependencies—just a clear, repeatable workflow

"Share blog: multimodal models. 3 ways to make LLMs multimodal.
LLM + Tools
LLM + Adapters
Unified Models","**Step 1: Purpose + Audience**

- **Purpose:** Share content (blog), educate about multimodal models, validate content idea, possibly drive blog traffic.
- **Audience:** Technical peers interested in AI, especially those wanting to leverage LLMs for more than text; likely has a mix of developers, early-stage founders, and AI-curious solopreneurs.

- CTA/Question: Focused, e.g., ""Which method are you experimenting with?""

---

**Step 3: Write the Meat of the Post**

Large language models (LLMs) are amazing with text—but the real magic happens when you make them multimodal.

There are 3 main approaches I see for adding multimodality to LLMs:

1. **LLM + Tools:** Let the model call external APIs or tools for images, audio, video, etc. Think ChatGPT plugins, browser tools, or vision APIs.
2. **LLM + Adapters:** Use small modular adapters to process different types of input, then connect those outputs to the LLM. This is flexible and modular, great for quick prototyping.
3. **Unified Models:** Train a single model to handle many modalities natively. Think GPT-4V or Google Gemini—these require much more data and compute, but can understand and generate across text, images, and more.

If you want a deeper breakdown (with practical examples), I just published a blog post digging into each approach.

Most people only know one way to make LLMs multimodal—there are actually three.

Large language models are amazing with text, but the real magic happens when you expand what they can *see*, *hear*, or *analyze*.

Here are the 3 main ways to make LLMs multimodal:

1. **LLM + Tools:** Connect your model to external APIs or tools (think: plugins, vision APIs, or scraping tools for new data types).
2. **LLM + Adapters:** Use small plugins or adapters to process images, audio, or other data, then feed structured info into the LLM—fast and modular.
3. **Unified Models:** Train a single model to handle many types of data at once (like GPT-4V or Gemini). More complex, but the most seamless.

While everyone’s busy talking about ChatGPT and language models, image-generation has also leapt forward—fast.  
FLUX.1, from the folks at Black Forest Labs (a spinoff of the Stable Diffusion team), is now state-of-the-art. I wanted to see just how good it could get… using my own face.

So I fine-tuned FLUX.1 with a personalized dataset (yep, selfies and all). The result: unlimited high-res photos of myself—in any style or setting.  
The process is much easier (and more fun) than most people expect, and there’s a ton you can learn by rolling up your sleeves and actually doing it.

- Meat:  
    - Brief intro—why multimodal embeddings matter  
    - 1-2 concrete examples of how they’re used  
    - Direct mention of what’s inside the blog (maybe 1 feature/lesson)  
    - Personal note—why Shaw wrote it, what surprised him  
- CTA: Point to the blog, tee up a single discussion question

---

Step 3: Body (“meat”)  
Most AI models are good at text or images, but struggle with both at once. That’s where multimodal embeddings come in. They help machines ‘understand’ relationships across language, vision, and sometimes even sound.

I broke down what multimodal embeddings are (with examples of how companies use them to power search, recommend content, and more) in my latest blog post. You’ll find:  
- A plain-English intro  
- Animations of how data moves from pixels/words to embeddings  
- A few open-source models to try

What surprised me researching this? The hidden tricks behind mapping *very* different data types into a shared mathematical “space”—it’s surprisingly elegant, and crazier under the hood than most tutorials admit.

If you want to get hands-on with AI that sees, reads, and connects across formats, this is a good starting point.

---

Step 4: CTA  
Curious: where do you see the most untapped potential for multimodal AI?

---

Step 5: Hook  
Step 5A: Hook angle brainstorms  
- [Problem/solution]: “Text and image models don’t speak the same language...but they should.”  
- [Beginner-to-expert clarity]: “Most tutorials on embeddings skip this crucial leap.”  
- [Results/outcome]: “How AI now connects your YouTube feed, Google Search, and TikTok—under the hood.”  
- [Personal story]: “I always thought embeddings were just a math trick, until I saw this...”  
- [Trend/urgency]: “The future of AI is multimodal—here’s what you need to know.”

Step 5B: Brief notes  
- Problem/solution: the “missing link” for real multimodal AI  
- Clarity: misconceptions; most see embeddings as just for text  
- Outcome: tangible platforms using this concept  
- Story: running into friction trying to use text + images together  
- Trend: rapid rise of multimodal models in production

Step 5C: Strongest direction: Beginner-to-expert clarity, tease problem and solution  
Chosen hook:  
Ever tried to build an AI that ‘gets’ both text and images—and hit a wall?

---

Step 6: Review  
- Hook is specific, addresses a common pain  
- Body is clear, notes motivation, gives value, and shares a learning  
- Clean ending CTA, single focused question  
- Invites engagement, not too jargon-heavy  
- Direct link to blog (to be inserted where needed)

**Step 3: Write the meat of the post first**

15 months ago, I left my job to go all-in on solopreneurship.

It didn’t go as planned.

There were months where I made almost nothing. I tried projects that flopped, courses that didn’t sell, blog posts no one read. Honestly, I thought about giving up—more than once.

Last month, something finally clicked. For the first time, I crossed $10k in a single month. Transparent breakdown:  
- **AI Builders Bootcamp:** $9,265.48  
- **Medium (blog):** $894.52  
- **YouTube:** $542.73  
- **Consulting calls:** $363.21  
**Total:** $10,826.72

Still not “passive income.” Still working long hours. But now I know: slow consistency compounds.

One honest win after 15 months of failures.

**Step 4: Write the CTA or question**

What’s been the hardest part of your own solopreneur journey?

---

**Step 5: Brainstorm hooks, step by step**

**Step 5A: Hook directions**
1. [Problem/solution]: “Most don’t talk about how long it takes to hit $10k/month as a solopreneur…”
2. [Personal story]: “I failed for 15 months straight. Here’s the exact month my work paid off.”
3. [Results]: “$10,826.72 in one month—as a solo creator (after 15 months of nothing).”
4. [Beginner-to-expert]: “If you’re struggling to get your first $10k month, here’s what my journey actually looked like.”
5. [Honest transparency]: “Real numbers: 15 months of failure, one win, and every revenue stream broken down.”

**Step 5B: Add notes**
1. [Problem/solution]: People underestimate time; focus on what’s not shown (the grind)
2. [Personal story]: Share reality of failing before win
3. [Results]: Lead with big number, show how it’s split
4. [Beginner-to-expert]: Validate slow journeys
5. [Honest transparency]: Tease concrete, real numbers

**Step 5C: Choose and write the hook**

Let’s go with: [Results + Real numbers]: Strong, direct, addresses pain point and curiosity.

15 months of failing. One $10k month—finally.

I left my job a year and a half ago to build something on my own.

It was much harder than I expected.  
Some months, I made almost nothing. My launches flopped. My blog posts stalled at 20 views. Honestly, I thought about quitting—more than once.

But I kept showing up. And last month, the work finally compounded:
- **AI Builders Bootcamp:** $9,265.48
- **Medium (blog):** $894.52
- **YouTube:** $542.73
- **Consulting calls:** $363.21

**Total:** $10,826.72

Not “overnight” at all.  
Not passive.  
But it’s proof that slow consistency (and a lot of failure) add up.

Milestone post: hitting 60k subs on YouTube. Why: learning and communication.,"Step 1: Purpose & Audience  
- **Purpose:** Share milestone, reflect on learning and communication lessons, deepen community connection  
- **Audience:** Aspiring educators, content creators, followers/subscribers, those interested in learning/teaching online  

Step 2: Wireframe  
- [Hook: Numbers + reflection or promise about learning/teaching]  
- [Body: Hit 60k YouTube subs, lessons about communication, what’s still hard, gratitude, grounded/real talk]  
- [CTA: Ask readers their biggest lesson about teaching/communication or how they approach learning out loud]  

Step 3: Body  
I just passed 60,000 subscribers on YouTube. Honestly, that number still feels surreal.  
When I published my first video, I was more focused on sharing what I knew than growing an audience.  
But after 60k new faces, here’s the truth: Learning and communication have nothing to do with “virality”—it’s about clarity, honesty, and solving small, real problems for people who care.  
I still record more “drafts” than “final takes.” I still get nervous hitting upload.  
But every question or comment reminds me: The world needs more people sharing what they’re learning—especially when it’s not perfect.  
Thank you for being here—for the feedback, corrections, and encouragement that made this possible.

Step 4: CTA  
What’s one lesson you’ve learned about teaching—or learning out loud?

Step 5A: Brainstorm hook angles  
- [Milestone/Numbers] “60,000 people—here’s what I’ve learned about teaching online”  
- [Personal truth] “I get nervous before every upload. Here’s why I keep hitting record.”  
- [Educational insight] “Growing a YouTube channel isn’t about going viral—it’s about clarity and honesty.”  
- [Community gratitude] “I wouldn’t be here without your questions and feedback.”  
- [Transparency] “Most of my videos start as rough drafts (and some stay there).”  

Step 5B: Add notes  
- [Milestone/Numbers]: Use ‘60,000’ in opening, tie to learning  
- [Personal truth]: Nervousness, imperfect content, sharing anyway  
- [Educational insight]: What matters isn’t “viral”—it’s clear/helpful  
- [Gratitude]: Direct thanks  
- [Transparency]: Drafts vs final takes  

Step 5C: Pick best direction  
- “60,000 people—here’s what I’ve learned about teaching online” is clear, direct, and uses the milestone.

Step 6: Review for Style  
- Clarity, humble/real, community, numbered milestone  
- Invite readers to share one lesson they’ve learned—simple, actionable CTA

Step 7: Final Post

60,000 people—here’s what I’ve learned about teaching online.

Last week, my YouTube channel hit 60,000 subscribers. That number still doesn’t feel real.

When I started, I thought the hard part was hitting “upload.”  
Turns out, the real challenge (and reward) is learning how to communicate clearly—especially when you don’t have all the answers.

What’s surprised me most:
- Most videos start as rough drafts (and plenty never make it out).
- The world doesn’t reward “perfect,” it rewards *useful* and *honest*.
- Feedback—from questions to corrections—is what makes this whole thing work.

I’m still figuring it out, but one thing’s clear:  
The best way to learn is to teach out loud, even (especially) when you feel unsure.

Thank you for following along—for your encouragement, feedback, and tough questions.

Corporate vs freelance data science. Key differences.,"**Step 1: Purpose & Audience**

- **Purpose:** Educate—share the key differences between corporate and freelance data science to inform those considering a shift or just curious.
- **Audience:** Data scientists (especially early- to mid-career), people considering freelancing, AI/tech professionals interested in career options.

---

**Step 2: Wireframe**

- Hook: Tease clarity on a common career fork—call out the corporate vs freelance divide in data science.
- Meat: Lay out 3–5 specific, real differences (ideally with a direct side-by-side or bulleted format). Include a hint at personal experience (“what I wish I knew before I switched,” etc.).
- CTA: Ask readers which side they're on, or what their experience has been.

---

**Step 3: The Meat**

Let’s lay out 4 key differences, with short bullets for each:

**1. Projects & Scope**  
- *Corporate*: You’re often tied to a specific product or department, working on long-term projects in a team.
- *Freelance*: You bounce between clients and industries, usually with shorter gigs and a need to wear many hats.

**2. Stability & Pay**  
- *Corporate*: Predictable paycheck, but capped earning potential and slow raises.
- *Freelance*: Income varies month to month, but ceiling is higher and you control your rates (if you can sell).

**3. Skills Used**  
- *Corporate*: Lots of meetings, stakeholder management, and often more time on data engineering than you’d think.
- *Freelance*: Heavy on client communication and project management—plus, you’re your own marketer and sales team.

**4. Control & Freedom**  
- *Corporate*: Structure, benefits, and clear expectations—but less say over your daily tasks.
- *Freelance*: Choose your projects, schedule, and tools (but the business side never sleeps).

*When I first went solo, I underestimated just how much time I’d spend managing clients and finding work—but I’ve also never learned faster.*

---

**Step 4: CTA/Question**

Which side are you on—or if you’ve tried both, what’s been your biggest surprise?

[Reviewing CTA: There’s an “or,” which violates the instruction. Let’s pick ONE.]

*What’s been your biggest surprise working freelance or corporate in data science?*

[Still has “or”—let’s refine.]

*What’s been your biggest surprise working freelance in data science?*

OR

*What’s the biggest career question you have about freelancing as a data scientist?*

Let’s go with the career question—it invites new freelancers to ask for help.

---

**Step 5: The Hook**

**5A. Brainstorm directions:**

- [Problem/solution] “Most data scientists wonder if the grass is greener outside the corporate world...”
- [Personal story] “Here’s what shocked me most after leaving corporate for freelance data science.”
- [Comparison/clarity] “Corporate vs freelance data science: The real tradeoffs (no fluff).”
- [Trend] “Why more data scientists are ditching corporate jobs for freelance freedom.”
- [Misconception] “Freelancing isn’t just 'more freedom'—these tradeoffs matter.”

**5B. Notes on each:**

- Problem/solution: Calls out the common wondering, promises insider clarity.
- Personal story: Adds credibility and humanizes.
- Comparison/clarity: Punchy, straight to the differences.
- Trend: Timely angle, but a little less grounded.
- Misconception: Could work, but might be too negative.

**5C. Choose & write the hook:**

Let's go with comparison/clarity, possibly blended with a touch of honesty.

**Final hook:**  
“Corporate vs freelance data science: Here’s what actually changes (beyond the paycheck).”

---

**Step 6: Review for Style, Sequence, Voice**

- Direct, clear, and practical.  
- Friendly “learn together” vibe.  
- Honest about both upsides and tradeoffs.  
- Ends with ONE CTA inviting reader questions about freelancing.

---

**Step 7: Final Post**

---

**Corporate vs freelance data science: Here’s what actually changes (beyond the paycheck).**

After working in both worlds, here are the key differences:

**1. Projects & Scope**  
- *Corporate*: You’re tied to a product or department—think big teams & long timelines.  
- *Freelance*: You bounce between clients and industries, usually with shorter-term projects and more variety.

**2. Stability & Pay**  
- *Corporate*: Predictable paychecks, predictable raises—but a cap on how fast you can grow.  
- *Freelance*: Your income varies, but you control your rates and sky’s the limit (if you’re good at selling your skills).

**3. Skills Used**  
- *Corporate*: Lots of meetings and stakeholder wrangling—plus, often more data engineering than you expect.  
- *Freelance*: You handle everything: client calls, proposals, project management, and delivery.

**4. Control & Freedom**  
- *Corporate*: Structure and benefits, but less freedom over what you work on.  
- *Freelance*: Maximum flexibility—but you’re also your own boss and sales team.

When I first switched, I totally underestimated how much time would go to finding work and managing clients. (Worth it for the learning curve, but it’s a real shift.)

---

**Step 1: Purpose & Audience**
- **Purpose:** Educate; share Shaw’s lessons learned to help others on a similar path (validate content idea around non-technical skills needed for data/AI entrepreneurship)
- **Audience:** Aspiring or early-stage data/AI entrepreneurs, freelancers, technical professionals considering entrepreneurship

**Step 2: Wireframe**
- Hook (tease the list and its importance for survival/success)
- List the 10 non-technical skills, perhaps with a little commentary/highlight to make each one tangible
- CTA: Invite audience to share which skill they wish they’d learned sooner

---

**Step 3: Body (“Meat”) of the Post**

Everyone thinks being a data entrepreneur is about algorithms and code.

But honestly? The hardest part has nothing to do with Python or AI models.

Here are 10 non-technical skills I had to learn the hard way:

1. **Explaining technical ideas simply** – If you can’t translate complex things, you can’t win trust or clients.
2. **Talking to customers** – The “real world” isn’t interested in jargon. Listen first, pitch second.
3. **Formulating business problems** – It’s useless to solve the wrong problem brilliantly.
4. **Asking the right questions** – Your first question is almost never the real one.
5. **Validating ideas before building** – Saves months of wasted effort (and sanity).
6. **Responding to emails, fast** – Opportunities disappear in an inbox.
7. **Sales** – Yes, you have to “sell” (and it’s learnable).
8. **Warm outreach** – The difference between “crickets” and real traction.
9. **Making landing pages** – A simple, clear page beats any pitch deck.
10. **Copywriting** – If your words aren’t clear, nothing else will matter.

None of these came naturally to me. Every one was (and still is) a work in progress.

- [Personal story] My survival as a data entrepreneur depended on 10 non-technical skills—here’s what I wish I’d learned first.
- [List/Numbers] 10 non-technical skills every data entrepreneur needs (but no one talks about)
- [Result/outcome] The non-technical skills that saved my data business.
- [Common misconception] Think being a data entrepreneur is all about code? Think again.

**Step 5B: Add notes**
- Problem/solution: Most junior founders ignore these, then get stuck with no clients, and confusion.
- Personal story: I screwed up sales/copy—missed great projects until I learned #7 and #10.
- List/Numbers: Everyone loves actionable lists, especially of the “what I wish I’d known” variety.
- Result/outcome: These saved my business—strong, but maybe hyperbolic for “saved.”
- Common misconception: Most never realize how much their “soft” skills run the show.

**Step 5C: Pick direction & write hook**

Strongest: List/numbers + misconception angle

**Final Hook:**  
If you think data entrepreneurship is all about technical skills—think again.  
Here are 10 non-technical skills I had to learn (the hard way).

If you think data entrepreneurship is all about technical skills—think again.

Here are 10 non-technical skills I had to learn (the hard way):

1. **Explaining technical ideas simply** – If you can’t translate complex things, you can’t win trust or clients.
2. **Talking to customers** – The “real world” isn’t interested in jargon. Listen first, pitch second.
3. **Formulating business problems** – It’s useless to solve the wrong problem brilliantly.
4. **Asking the right questions** – Your first question is almost never the real one.
5. **Validating ideas before building** – Saves months of wasted effort (and sanity).
6. **Responding to emails, fast** – Opportunities disappear in an inbox.
7. **Sales** – Yes, you have to “sell” (and it’s learnable).
8. **Warm outreach** – The difference between “crickets” and real traction.
9. **Making landing pages** – A simple, clear page beats any pitch deck.
10. **Copywriting** – If your words aren’t clear, nothing else will matter.

None of these came naturally to me. Every one was (and still is) a work in progress.

Which of these skills do you wish you’d learned sooner?"
"15 things I had to learn to become a (data) entrepreneur
Ability to identify pain points
Coding
Effectively use AI tools
How to sell
Talk to clients
Write
Make a website

Cold out bound
Just post
Look foolish
Constantly learn","Step 1: Purpose & Audience
- Purpose: Educate and inspire (show what it really takes to become a data entrepreneur, humanizing the journey, sharing the often-overlooked skills)
- Audience: Aspiring data entrepreneurs, solopreneurs, people interested in using AI to build a business or consulting career

Step 2: Wireframe

```
[Engaging 1-2 line hook (above the fold on LinkedIn)]

[Meat: List the 15 lessons as clear, scannable bullets, and add 1–2 closing sentences reflecting on what really matters]

[Focused CTA or question (ONE only)]
```

Step 3: Write the meat

Here are the 15 things I had to learn the hard way to become a (data) entrepreneur:

1. Spot real pain points (not just “interesting ideas”)
2. Write code that solves those specific problems
3. Effectively leverage AI tools (beyond just playing—it must move the needle)
4. Actually sell what I built (even if it felt awkward)
5. Have real conversations with clients, not just “do the work”
6. Write clearly—especially when explaining technical concepts
7. Build my own website (even if it looked bad at first)
8. Make my own content (even when nobody was watching)
9. Send cold outbound emails (even when they were ignored)
10. Just hit ‘post’ (even with imposter syndrome)
11. Be willing to look foolish (it’s part of the job)
12. Constantly learn new skills and tools (the field moves fast)
13. Stay accountable without a boss or team
14. Separate what matters from noise (shiny tools ≠ progress)
15. Keep showing up—even when nothing seems to work

It’s rarely just about code, or just about business—it's extreme adaptability. Most of these lessons only clicked once I stumbled, failed, tried again, and kept going.

Step 4: CTA/Question

What’s been the hardest skill for you to actually learn so far?

Step 5: Hook Iteration

5A: Brainstorm directions
- [Problem/solution] Most “how to start” lists skip these messy realities. 
- [Personal story] I wish someone told me THIS before I started.
- [Results/outcomes] 15 surprisingly tough skills behind my (data) entrepreneurship.
- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] Everyone talks about code, no one talks about THIS.
- [Humor/honesty] 15 things no one warns you about when you try to build your own business.

5B: Add notes/examples
- [Problem/solution] “Most lists talk about coding, but ignore cold emails, embarrassment, posting when no one cares… Here’s a real list.”
- [Personal story] “I had to trip over every one of these myself, but maybe this helps you shortcut at least a few.”
- [Results/outcomes] “15 skills it really took—most aren’t what you’d expect.”
- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “It’s not just code or AI. These are the real skills.”
- [Humor/honesty] “If you want to feel foolish, start a solo (data) business. Here’s my list.”

5C: Pick strongest direction
The most Shaw angle is honest, “if only someone told me,” and sharply exposes the hidden/unspoken skills.

Final hook:

The hardest part of becoming a (data) entrepreneur wasn’t learning code—it was all the stuff nobody talks about.

Step 6: Review for style, sequence, voice
- Friendly, approachable, honest about failures, direct about messy realities
- Clear, scannable list, with a brief reflection

"My $15,000 AI content creation strategy","**Step 1: Purpose + Audience**  
- **Purpose:** Share Shaw’s tested, revenue-generating AI content strategy (educate, demonstrate credibility, and spark discussion).
- **Audience:** Aspiring AI creators, solopreneurs, freelancers, and others interested in monetizing AI-driven content.

**Step 2: Wireframe**  
1. [Hook teasing the $15,000 strategy or sharing outcome]  
2. [Story of the approach, steps, or what makes it work—clear, practical, grounded in experience; possibly include a quick breakdown/list or numbers for structure.]  
3. [Single CTA: invite reader’s perspective, ask about their biggest barrier, etc.]

---

**Step 3: Write the body (“meat”) of the post first**

Here’s exactly how I used AI to bring in $15,000 with content:

1. **Picked a Niche Where I Had Real Expertise**  
I chose topics (AI workflows, agents, technical education) where I could teach from experience—not just chase trends.

2. **Mapped My Content to Real Problems**  
Every post, video, or resource answered life-or-death freelancer questions:  
- “How do I actually get clients with AI?”  
- “Can I automate the parts of my business I hate?”

3. **Built (and Shared) Micro-Projects**  
Instead of vague tips, I built real mini-tools and shared the process step-by-step.  
People DM’d me daily for code, walkthroughs, and strategy calls.

4. **Used Free Distribution (With a Catch)**  
I published on LinkedIn, Twitter, and YouTube—where my ideal client was already hanging out.  
But I nudged EVERY post toward my newsletter or a consult call.

5. **Charged for Deep Dives and Templates**  
Once people saw my free stuff, selling tailored breakdowns, templates, or 1-on-1 help became easy.  
No cheesy sales tactics—just “here’s the code, here’s the price if you want the full system.”

It wasn’t overnight. But with consistent, useful content centered on real, actionable value, $15k became just the start.

2. [Problem/solution] “Struggling to monetize your AI content? Here’s the exact strategy that brought in my first $15,000.”  
3. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “The mistake most AI creators make before they ever earn a dime.”  
4. [Personal story] “I never thought teaching AI online would bring in $15k…”  
5. [Numbers/process] “5 steps that took me from $0 to $15,000 with AI content.”

Step 5B: Short notes on each  
1. [Results] Grabs attention, promises a playbook.  
2. [Problem/solution] Empathizes, offers hope.  
3. [Clarity] Hints at a pitfall and solution.  
4. [Personal] Relatable, humble beginning.  
5. [Numbers/process] Implies actionable steps.

Step 5C: Choose strongest direction & write final hook  
I’ll choose [Results/outcomes], reframe slightly for boldness and clarity:

**Final hook:**

"5 Tips for Building AI systems That Are Useless and Forgotten
Spend no time on data curation
Assume your data quality is good (without looking)
Only train one version of your model
Focus more on using new tech over the business problem
Don’t worry about evals until ready to push to prod","Step 1:  
- **Purpose:** Educate, in a lighthearted/contrarian way, about common mistakes in building AI systems. Share practical wisdom by framing it as what *not* to do.  
- **Target Audience:** AI builders, technical founders, and product-minded engineers—people working with AI projects and models.

Step 2: **Post Wireframe**  
- Hook: Contrarian angle (what *not* to do), using humor/sarcasm.
- Meat: List the 5 negative “tips” that ensure your AI is useless/forgotten, with brief clarifications.
- CTA: What mistake have you seen most often? (Focused engagement prompt.)

Step 3: **Body (“Meat”) of the Post**  
Want your AI systems to be ignored and forgotten? Here’s a surefire recipe:

1. **Spend zero time on data curation.**  
   Who needs clean or relevant data when you could just throw in whatever’s lying around?

2. **Assume data quality is excellent (without actually checking).**  
   If it loaded, it must be good… Right?

3. **Only train one version of your model.**  
   Iteration is overrated. Why learn from feedback or try new things?

4. **Prioritize using shiny new tech over solving a real business problem.**  
   If it has “GPT” in it, who cares if it’s useful?

5. **Forget about evaluation until you’re about to deploy.**  
   Evals are for later (or never).

I’ve seen every one of these kill promising projects—sometimes even my own, early on.

Step 4: **CTA/Question**  
What’s the most painful AI mistake you’ve seen in the wild?

Step 5: **Hook Brainstorming**

**Step 5A: Labeled directions for hooks**
- [Contrarian list]: “Want your AI project to go nowhere fast? Follow these 5 steps.”
- [Personal story]: “Early in my career, I wasted months by making mistake #2…”
- [Problem/Solution]: “Most failed AI products have these 5 things in common.”  
- [Humor]: “How to guarantee your AI system is useless (5 proven strategies)”
- [Result/Consequence]: “Why do so many AI systems end up gathering dust?”

**Step 5B: Notes for each**
- [Contrarian list]: Leans into reverse advice, light sarcasm.
- [Personal story]: Makes Shaw more relatable, but this prompt is for a list.
- [Problem/Solution]: Might be more earnest than the user wants.
- [Humor]: Calls out “proven strategies” for failure.
- [Result/Consequence]: Opens with the outcome (abandoned systems).

**Step 5C: Best direction:** Humor/Contrarian (""How to guarantee..."" angle). Punchy, on-brand for Shaw.

**Drafted Hook:**  
How to make sure your AI system is completely useless (the 5-step method).

Step 6: **Review for Voice, Style, Sequence**

- Clean bulleted structure.
- Ends with a single, actionable question.

How to make sure your AI system is completely useless (the 5-step method):

Want your AI project to be ignored, forgotten, or just plain irrelevant? Here’s the recipe:

1. **Spend zero time on data curation.**  
Why bother cleaning data when you can just grab whatever’s handy?

2. **Assume your data quality is great (without checking).**  
If it loaded, it must be solid… right?

3. **Only train one version of your model.**  
Iteration? Overrated. Just pick a model and hope for the best.

4. **Get distracted by every shiny new tech, not the actual problem.**  
If it’s trending, it must be the answer.

5. **Ignore evaluation until launch day.**  
Evals are future-you’s problem—maybe.

I’ve seen every single one of these kill promising AI projects (guilty of a few myself, early on).

Story of top ai leader at big consulting firm booking me for AI coaching,"Step 1: Clarify Purpose & Audience  
- **Purpose:** Build credibility by sharing a direct story of being approached by a leader at a top consulting firm for AI coaching (authority signal, also educates about the value of external coaching)
- **Audience:** Fellow entrepreneurs, potential clients curious about the value of AI education/coaching, professionals considering upskilling in AI

Step 2: Wireframe  
- Hook: Tease credibility, surprise, ego validation, or an “aha” moment  
- Story meat: Succinct narration—how/why the consulting leader reached out, what they wanted, your reaction, and maybe a brief takeaway  
- CTA: Question for reader, e.g., “Who do you learn from when you’re the expert?” or “Ever been in this position?” (Pick one.)

Step 3: Write the Meat   
- Share moment the leader reached out (what surprised you)
- Why would a top expert at a major firm hire an “outsider” for AI?
- The conversation: what they asked, what you realized about gaps in big organizations
- Brief key learning: everyone needs external input, expertise has no finish line

Step 4: CTA  
- Possible: “Who do you turn to for outside perspective?”  
- Other: “Ever been hired to teach something to the ‘experts?’ What surprised you?”

Pick one: I’ll go with “Who do you turn to for outside perspective?”

Step 5: Hook   
Step 5A: Labelled directions  
- [Status flip] “The ‘expert’ booked me—here’s what happened.”
- [Humility/learning] “Even leaders at top consulting firms need a coach sometimes.”
- [Contrarian] “Why do companies with teams of AI experts call in outsiders?”
- [Personal surprise] “Didn’t expect this LinkedIn DM: ‘Can you coach our AI team?’”
- [Relatable question] “Ever get hired to help a team that ‘shouldn’t’ need you?”

Step 5B: Short notes  
- [Status flip] Focus on table-turn, maybe fun ego-check
- [Humility/learning] Everyone has blind spots, even experts
- [Contrarian] Outsider input > internal echo chamber
- [Personal surprise] Genuine shock at being tapped by the “big guys”
- [Relatable question] Hits on imposter syndrome + expertise

Step 5C: Select & Write Hook  
Strongest is [Status flip] with an element of [Humility/learning]:  
“When the ‘expert’ asks you to be their coach, something interesting happens.”

Step 6: Review Style, Sequence, Voice  
- Short, direct sentences  
- Personal story, humble not bragging  
- Straight to the surprise: why me?  
- Clean CTA

Step 7: Final Post

When the ‘expert’ asks you to be their coach, something interesting happens.

Last month, I got a DM from a leader at one of the world’s top consulting firms.  
They have a whole division dedicated to AI. Dozens of PhDs.  
And yet, here’s what he said:  
“Shaw, can I book you for private AI coaching?”

We got on a call.  
He wanted help understanding not just how AI tools work, but how to apply them practically—beyond slides and strategy decks.

The conversation reminded me of something I often forget:  
Even the “experts” need outsiders to challenge their thinking.  
There’s always more to learn, no matter how many credentials are in the room.

Who do you turn to for outside perspective?"

**Step 1: Purpose & Audience**

- **Purpose:** Educate and inspire technical practitioners to build their own local document QA bot, demystifying the stack and inviting practical experimentation.
- **Target Audience:** Technical learners, indie hackers, AI enthusiasts, and folks curious about building real-world AI projects (especially Shaw’s followers interested in hands-on agent automation).

---

**Step 2: Wireframe**

- Hook: Pain point around privacy/local-first AI and wanting practical projects.
- Meat:  
    - Pain point
    - Solution/idea: DIY local doc QA, stack (Ollama + Gradio)
    - Steps (pseudo-code, bullet clarity)
    - Helpful resources/libraries
- CTA: What would you build with a local doc QA bot?

---

**Step 3: Write the Meat of the Post**

Tired of sending your private docs to the cloud just to get answers?  
Let’s build a privacy-friendly document Q&A bot — all local.

**The Stack:**  
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com) (runs open-source language models locally)  
- [Gradio](https://gradio.app) (easy web UIs)

**Here’s the high-level plan:**  
1. **Load documents:** PDF, TXT, or Markdown from your machine.
2. **Chunk and embed:** Break text into chunks, turn into vector embeddings (e.g., with `sentence-transformers`).
3. **Index chunks locally:** Store in a vector database (e.g., `faiss` or even Python dict for small stuff).
4. **Set up search:** For a user question, fetch the most relevant chunks by similarity.
5. **Call Ollama:** Pass the question + retrieved docs to an LLM—all on your computer.
6. **Front-end:** Use Gradio to create a chat-style interface.

**Helpful libraries/resources:**  
- [`ollama`](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama) (API/docs)  
- [`gradio`](https://gradio.app) (Docs/examples)  
- [`sentence-transformers`](https://www.sbert.net/)  
- [`faiss`](https://faiss.ai/) (for fast similarity search)

- [Personal]: First-person, “after I realized XYZ about privacy”
- [Beginner Clarity]: Lower barrier, “Don’t be intimidated by LLMs”
- [Trend]: New ecosystem of local tools, “Ollama is exploding”
- [Numbers]: Fast win, how-to energy “6 steps, real stack”

**Step 5C: Pick Strongest Direction & Write Hook**

I’ll go with [Problem/solution] and combine a touch of the “trend”:  
“Want to chat with your docs—without sending data to the cloud? Here’s a local-first project: Your own Q&A bot with Ollama + Gradio.”

**Want to chat with your docs—without sending data to the cloud?**  
Here’s a local-first project: your own Q&A bot, powered by Ollama + Gradio. 🧑‍💻

Tired of sharing private files with cloud LLMs just to ask a question?  
It’s simpler (and safer) than you think to build your own, all on your laptop.

**Here’s the blueprint:**
1. **Load documents:** Import PDFs, TXTs, or Markdown files from your machine.
2. **Chunk & embed:** Break text into chunks and create vector embeddings (try `sentence-transformers`).
3. **Index locally:** Store embeddings in a fast vector database—`faiss` is great for this.
4. **Search:** For each user question, find the most relevant chunks via similarity search.
5. **Answer:** Feed the retrieved snippets + query to Ollama’s local LLM, get your answer.
6. **Interface:** Spin up a chat app with Gradio for an easy web UI.

**Helpful libraries/resources:**  
- [`ollama`](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama)  
- [`gradio`](https://gradio.app)  
- [`sentence-transformers`](https://www.sbert.net/)  
- [`faiss`](https://faiss.ai/)

"My biggest mistake: pursing AI consulting when my goal was to develop products.
Free AI consultations (for target customer)
Make content about it
Book more calls
Make more content
Build prototypes
Get feedback from customers
Repeat
","Let's break this down step by step.

---

**Step 1: Purpose & Audience**  
- **Purpose:** Share a personal lesson learned—validate the idea of using free consultations as a path to product development, and inspire others to do the same.  
- **Target Audience:** Aspiring AI entrepreneurs, technical solopreneurs, those interested in turning consulting into product opportunities.

---

**Step 2: Wireframe**

```
[Hook: My #1 mistake building in AI (and the flywheel I'm using instead)]

[Meat: Personal story of chasing AI consulting, realization about misalignment with product goal, discovery of the “free consultation” loop, bullet points on the flywheel process]

[CTA: What would you build if you had direct access to your dream customers every week?]
```

---

**Step 3: Write the meat/body**

The biggest mistake I made early on: focusing on landing AI consulting gigs when what I *really* wanted was to ship my own products.

Consulting brought me closer to customer problems—but farther from building anything scalable.

Here's what's working for me now instead:  
- I offer free AI consultations (specifically targeting my ideal customer).  
- I turn every call into new content—clips, case studies, lessons.  
- Content brings more calls.  
- Calls inform rapid prototypes.  
- Prototypes get me real feedback from real users.  
- The cycle repeats, each time inching closer to actual product-market fit.

It’s not just theory—it’s a hands-on loop that builds audience, surfaces pain points, and feeds your product roadmap.

---

**Step 4: Write the SINGLE CTA**

What would you build if you had direct access to your dream customers every week?

---

**Step 5: Hook ideation (Step 5A/B/C)**

Step 5A: Brainstorm 3–5 labeled directions:  
1. [Personal story/failure] “How chasing consulting gigs kept me from real product progress”  
2. [Problem/solution] “Struggling to turn consulting into a repeatable product? Try this flywheel.”  
3. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “Why most AI builders get stuck consulting (and how to escape).”  
4. [Result] “How free calls turned into prototypes and early users.”  
5. [Vulnerability] “My #1 mistake as an AI entrepreneur (and how I fixed it).”

Step 5B: Short notes for each direction:  
1. Consulting paid, but distracted from core goal—building products  
2. Outline a repeatable cycle: free calls, content, prototypes  
3. Common trap: earning through consulting, not building assets  
4. Free consultations → content → calls → prototypes → feedback  
5. Mistake: consulting with wrong intention; fix = build feedback-driven loop

Step 5C: Choose strongest direction and write hook.  
I think combining #1 and #5 best matches Shaw’s voice: honest, vulnerable, practical.

---

**Step 6: Review sequence, clarity, voice**

- Clear, personal, not hyped
- Shows the consulting → content → prototype cycle
- Ends with a single question inviting creative reflection

---

**Step 7: Write the final post**

---

**Final LinkedIn Post:**

My #1 mistake as an AI entrepreneur? Chasing consulting gigs when I really wanted to build products.

Consulting brought cash flow and customer insight—but it kept me stuck solving *other* people's problems, not creating my own solutions.

Here’s the flywheel I use now:
- Offer free AI consultations (just for my dream customer)
- Turn every call into actionable content
- Let the content attract more calls
- Use these calls to build quick prototypes
- Get direct feedback—fast
- Repeat, every week

This loop forces you into real conversations, delivers content ideas, and brings you closer to building something people actually want.

What would you build if you had direct access to your dream customers every week?"
"5 Resume Myths That Kept Me Unemployed
more is better
I don’t need to tailor my resume
I need an objective statement
Writing down my experience is enough
I don’t need a portfolio","**Step 1: Purpose & Audience**

- **Purpose:** Educate and share a lesson by debunking common resume myths from personal experience. Signal expertise and relate directly to job-seekers, potential students, and early-career professionals feeling stuck.
- **Target Audience:** Job seekers, recent grads, career switchers, and anyone learning to market themselves for tech/AI roles.

---

**Step 2: Wireframe**

- **Hook:** Personal pain of unemployment caused by resume myths.
- **Meat:** List and briefly debunk the top 5 myths, with short notes from Shaw's POV.
- **CTA:** Invite the reader to share the resume myth that held them back.

---

**Step 3: Write the Body**

Here are 5 resume myths that kept me spinning my wheels—and what I wish I’d known sooner:

1. **More is better:**  
   Long resumes just mean recruiters won’t read them. Clarity wins over quantity every time.

2. **I don’t need to tailor my resume:**  
   Generic applications rarely get noticed. When I started customizing my resume for each role, my interviews skyrocketed.

3. **I need an objective statement:**  
   Most objective statements are vague fluff. Replace them with a strong summary that spotlights results or skills.

4. **Writing down my experience is enough:**  
   I used to list what I did, not what I accomplished. Quantified impact (numbers, results) makes all the difference.

5. **I don’t need a portfolio:**  
   Especially in AI or tech—showing real projects sets you apart. A portfolio isn’t just nice-to-have, it’s your secret weapon.

**Step 5: The Hook — Step-by-step brainstorm**

**Step 5A: Brainstorm 3–5 Labeled Directions for the Hook**
1. [Problem/solution] — Directly call out the pain of following bad advice and being stuck.
2. [Personal Story] — Tease a personal “I stayed unemployed until…” angle.
3. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] — “Most resumes fail because of these 5 myths…”
4. [Results] — “Once I broke these resume myths, I landed my next job.”

**Step 5B: Notes on Each Direction**
1. [Problem/solution] — “Are you still unemployed? These myths kept me stuck way too long.”
2. [Personal story] — “I wasted months with the wrong resume—here are the mistakes I wish I’d fixed sooner.”
3. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] — “Why your resume isn’t working (and what to do instead).”
4. [Results] — “Fixed these 5 things and suddenly recruiters noticed.”

**Step 5C: Pick & Write Final Hook**
The most compelling hook is the personal story—honest, relatable, and results-oriented.

**Final Hook:**  
I stayed unemployed for months because I believed these resume myths.

**Step 3: Write the Body**

Most people still think “LLM” means “fancy chatbot.”  
But here are 3 practical ways I’ve seen LLMs transform everyday work—without ever chatting back:

1. **Lead Scoring at Scale**  
   Feed in lead records—an LLM can quickly scan emails, messages, or notes and predict which contacts are warmest, based on patterns it “learns” from your sales history. Zero coding; just data-in, prioritized leads out.

2. **Unsupervised Lead Clustering / Customer Segmentation**  
   Pipe all your client notes into an LLM, prompt it to organize by patterns—like needs, industry, or deal size. You’ll spot hidden customer segments (or pain points) you never saw before.

3. **Automated LinkedIn Post Writing**  
   Train an LLM on your past content and instruct it on your voice. Now it drafts posts—tailored to your style, audience, and goals—leaving you to polish and publish in minutes instead of hours.

What is data quality? Accuracy and diversity.,"Let’s follow the outlined reasoning steps:

---

**Step 1: Purpose & Audience**

- **Purpose:** Educate; break down what “data quality” really means in AI/ML contexts.  
- **Audience:** AI-curious professionals, beginner/intermediate students, people building or learning about AI who hear ""data quality"" but need clarity.

---

**Step 2: Wireframe**

- **Hook:** Juicy, clarity-focused opener about data quality.
- **Meat:** Explain that data quality is more than just ""accuracy""—also ""diversity."" Why both matter, practical examples, real-world flavor.
- **CTA:** Simple, precise: Ask audience how they judge ""data quality"" or to suggest additional dimensions they’d add.

---

**Step 3: Write the Meat**

Let’s break it down clearly:
- Many people think “data quality” = “how correct is this?”
- That’s only part of it.
- Accuracy = your data actually reflects reality (no typos, facts are correct, etc.)
- But diversity matters: Does your data cover the full range of cases your system will face? Is it just one demographic, one scenario, etc.?
- If you only have accuracy but not diversity, your AI will fail on new or outlier cases.
- If you have diversity but no accuracy, you have noise.
- Example: Imagine a face ID system trained only on one age group, even if all the faces are labeled perfectly.
- True data quality means your AI sees both the correct *and* a wide slice of the world.

---

**Step 4: CTA/Question**

“Is there a third dimension of data quality you check for in your projects?”

---

**Step 5: Hook**

**Step 5A: Brainstorm directions**
1. [Problem/solution] “Most think data quality is only about fixing errors—it's much more.”
2. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “You can’t fix bad predictions with perfect data—unless you look beyond accuracy.”
3. [Personal story] “My first AI project failed because I ignored this.”
4. [Trend/urgency] “Model audits often miss this simple data test.”
5. [Result/outcome] “Want your AI to work in the real world? Check this first.”

**Step 5B: Add notes**
1. “People try to ‘clean’ data but forget real-world coverage.”
2. “Projects fail even when every entry is correct.”
3. “Learned the hard way: completeness matters as much as correctness.”
4. Headlines have been about bias in models lately—often a diversity issue.
5. The top mistake new teams make is slacking on this.

**Step 5C: Final hook**
Let’s pick the clarity/beginner-to-expert angle:

“Most people think ‘data quality’ just means ‘no errors.’ But that's only half the story.”

---

**Step 6: Review for Style & Voice**

- Clarity? ✅
- Real-world, grounded? ✅
- Invites engagement? ✅
- Short, scannable? ✅

---

**Step 7: Final Post**

---

Most people think “data quality” just means having no errors. But that's only half the story.

Data quality actually has two pillars:

• **Accuracy:** Is your data correct? No typos, no wrong labels, no missing values.  
• **Diversity:** Does your data truly represent the range of situations your model will face? All demographics, edge cases, and scenarios—so your system isn't shocked by something “unusual.”

If you only focus on accuracy, your AI might work perfectly—until it hits real-world data it’s never seen.  
If you only chase diversity, you might end up with lots of edge cases... but if the labels are wrong, the model still fails.

True data quality means checking *both*:  
Are you feeding your AI data that is both correct and broad enough?

Is there a third dimension of data quality you check for in your projects?"
