[CTA: focused question to spark discussion]

Step 3 (Body):
Here are 5 AI principles I know at 29, that I wish I’d known at 24:

1. Don’t use AI (unless you truly need it).
It’s tempting to reach for AI for every problem—but most don’t need it. Start simple.

2. Focus on problems, not tech.
Chasing cool tech is fun, but solving real problems is what matters. Put the use-case first, always.

3. Spend more time on data curation.
Garbage in, garbage out. The hours you spend curating good data almost always pay off more than tuning models.

4. Data quality > data quantity.
A handful of high-quality examples can beat mountains of noisy data.

5. Run experiments.
Theoretical debates are endless—build things, try ideas, and learn from actual results.

- [Mistakes/regret angle] The advice that would have saved me years
- [Beginner-to-expert] 5 fundamentals most people overlook when starting out
- [Problem/solution] Why focusing on data beats fancy algorithms every time
- [Personal reflection] The truth I wish someone told my younger self about AI

Step 5B (Notes on each direction):
- [User’s own phrasing]: Direct, personal, chronological (strong peer mentor voice)
- [Mistakes/regret]: Heavy on honesty, likely relatable. “Would have saved me pain/time”
- [Beginner-to-expert]: Focus on overlooked basics—positioned for those starting
- [Problem/solution]: Highlights a recurring, practical mistake
- [Personal reflection]: Focuses on self-advice; strong for relatability

Step 5C (Choose & write hook):
Best angle: Leverage user’s honest, personal frame—“5 AI principles I know at 29, I wish I’d known at 24.” This signals reflection, expertise, and makes the age timeframe concrete.

Step 6 (Draft of full post):
5 AI principles I know at 29, I wish I’d known at 24.

If you’re early in your AI journey, save yourself some pain:

1. Don’t use AI (unless you really need it).
Most problems don’t need machine learning—start with the simplest tool that works.

2. Focus on problems, not tech.
The coolest architecture is useless if it doesn’t solve a real problem. Always put the use-case first.

3. Spend more time on data curation.
The quality of your raw data impacts everything. Invest more time up front—it pays off later.

4. Data quality > data quantity.
A small, well-labeled dataset can outperform a huge messy one. Don’t get caught up in chasing big numbers.

5. Run experiments.
The best lessons come from building things and seeing what does (and doesn’t) work.

- Target audience: Aspiring AI engineers, students, early-career technical professionals, and solo builders intimidated by the ""top"" crowd.

Step 2: Wireframe
[Hook]
Most top AI engineers aren’t more intelligent than you—they just do this one thing more…

[Body]

Step 3: Body
Everyone loves to talk about how “genius” the top AI engineers are.

In my experience, the real differentiator isn’t IQ.
It’s that they obsessively build, experiment, and ship projects—even the ones that fail.

Every model, tool, evaluation, or little automation is a new rep. Over time, the builders pull ahead, not by being smarter, but by putting ideas into practice (even the messy ones).

If you’re feeling behind, don’t wait for the perfect moment or idea. Build something—anything. That motion is where the learning (and compounding skill) happens.

Being a solopreneur = you’re the CEO, marketer, engineer, and support all at once.

But thanks to LLMs, I’ve managed to ""hire"" a mini-team—no payroll needed.

Here are 7 use cases that have given me massive leverage:

1. Coding assistant: Debugging code, prototyping new features, pair programming late at night.
2. Going from 0 to 1 on new topics: Asking for high-level overviews, resource lists, and example projects so I can ramp up fast.
3. Writing copy: Generating landing page text, social media posts, and email copy quickly (without overthinking).
4. Email outreach scripts: Creating tailored outreach templates so I can connect with leads faster.
5. ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) refinement: Brainstorming ICPs, user personas, and pain points to keep me focused.
6. Podcasts into blogs: Summarizing, outlining, and even tweaking tone to turn spoken content into written pieces.
7. Creating peer groups for my courses: Automating onboarding and matching students into relevant peer communities.

LLMs won’t replace every job, but for solo founders, they can take entire tasks off your plate—letting you build more with less.

Which of these would have the biggest impact for you?

If you're building, selling, or working with AI, it's critical to know which 'generation' you're talking about. Each one brings new risks, opportunities, and challenges.

Step 4: CTA/Question
Which 'generation' of software are you most excited (or worried) about?

Step 5: Hooks - Brainstorming Directions
A. [User's own phrasing/problem] 'AI means different things to different people.'
B. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] 'Not all AI is created equal. Here are the 3 types you should know.'
C. [Trend/urgency] 'We're living through a shift from rule-based code to talking machines.'
D. [Numbers/visual] 'Software 1.0 → 2.0 → 3.0: Why most ""AI"" debates go in circles.'
E. [Problem/solution] 'Is AI just if-statements? Neural nets? LLMs? The answer: yes.'

Step 5B: Short notes to each direction
A. Opens with confusion; appeals to those lost in jargon
B. Direct, positions reader to learn something foundational
C. Makes the post feel timely/important
D. Leverages numbers/sequence for clarity
E. Highlights the overlapping/confusing uses of 'AI' and quickly resolves with answer

Step 5C: Pick strongest direction
D. 'Software 1.0 → 2.0 → 3.0: Why most ""AI"" debates go in circles.'
- Clear use of numbers, hints at confusion/clarity—likely to hook readers.

Step 6: Draft Full Post
Software 1.0 → 2.0 → 3.0: Why most ""AI"" debates go in circles.

AI means something different to almost everyone you ask.

Sometimes it’s a simple rule-based engine. Sometimes it’s deep learning. Sometimes it’s ChatGPT.

Here’s how I break it down when thinking about software:

- Software 1.0 = Rule-based systems (old school code—if/else statements and hardcoded rules)
- Software 2.0 = Machine learning (systems that learn from data instead of being programmed directly)
- Software 3.0 = Large Language Models (systems that can generate, reason, and adapt using language)

If you're building or buying an ""AI solution,"" knowing what generation you're dealing with changes everything—from expectations to safety to business value.

Which 'generation' of software are you most excited (or worried) about?

Step 7: Review for Style, Voice, Flow
- No em dash misuse⚡
- No repeated phrases or numbers in hook
- Clarity, scannability with line breaks and bullets
- Invites conversation—doesn’t assume a hard opinion, just frames the landscape
- Approachable teaching voice
- No fabricated personal results/experiences

Step 8: Final Post below.","Software 1.0 → 2.0 → 3.0: Why most ""AI"" debates go in circles.

- [Problem/solution]: Speaks to readers’ overwhelm.
- [Step-by-step clarity]: Emphasizes the actionable roadmap.
- [Beginner empathy]: Builds trust, shows understanding of beginner pain.
- [Personal story]: Creates curiosity—a reset/“from scratch” story.

Step 5C: Choose Hook Direction
Strongest: “How I’d learn AI in 2025 (if I knew nothing)” — clean, promise-driven, and immediately sets context. User’s own phrasing is clear and strong.

Step 6: Draft Full Post
How I’d learn AI in 2025 (if I knew nothing)

The AI world can feel overwhelming—especially if you’re starting from zero.

If I had to begin again, here’s the roadmap I’d follow:

1. Use ChatGPT (or a similar AI tool)
    - Get comfortable asking questions, getting explanations, and iterating with an AI assistant. This will give you instant feedback and help you build confidence.

2. Install Python
    - Python is the language of AI. Download Anaconda (or just use your terminal/command line) and start tinkering with basic code snippets.

3. Build an Automation (Beginner)
    - Use Python to automate a simple repetitive task in your daily life (renaming files, data entry, etc). This bridges theory and practical skills.

4. Build an ML Project (Intermediate)
    - Try a small project—maybe predicting housing prices, classifying text, or something similar with scikit-learn. Don’t worry about perfection—focus on finishing.

5. Build a Real-world Project (Advanced)
    - Take a real problem you care about and solve it with AI. This might be a hobby project, a freelance prototype, or something to showcase in your portfolio.

That’s the sequence I’d follow—one step at a time.

What would you add to this beginner’s roadmap?

Step 7: Style/Voice/Flow Review
- No repeated phrases/words in the first lines.
- One em dash total; not repeated.
- Natural, clear, conversational, beginner-friendly tone.
- Bulleted/numbered for readability.
- Ends with a single question.

Step 8: Write the final post.","How I’d learn AI in 2025 (if I knew nothing)

The AI world can feel overwhelming—especially if you’re starting from scratch.

If I had to begin again, here’s the path I’d follow:

1. Use ChatGPT (or a similar AI tool)
   - Get comfortable asking questions and experimenting. Use AI as your learning partner from day one.

2. Install Python
   - Python powers most things in AI. Download Anaconda or set up your environment however you like, and try running your first scripts.

3. Build an Automation (Beginner)
   - Use Python to automate something simple in your daily workflow (think: renaming files, scraping data, or basic calculations). This makes programming immediately useful.

4. Build an ML Project (Intermediate)
   - Take on a beginner machine learning project. Predict prices, classify emails—just get hands-on with data and models.

5. Build a Real-world Project (Advanced)
   - Pick a problem you care about and use AI to solve it. This could be a personal project, a freelance sample, or something for your portfolio.

That’s my roadmap—practical, project-based, and focused on learning by doing.

- Purpose: Educate and share Shaw’s approach to managing technical debt when building with AI, providing practical criteria for language/library choices.
- Audience: Fellow AI builders, solopreneurs, technical freelancers, and anyone navigating tech stack decisions when building AI projects.

Step 2: Post Wireframe

- Meat: Two key factors Shaw personally considers (experience with language/library and project runtime frequency), short explanations of each, and how these shape technical debt decisions.
- CTA: Ask readers how they manage technical debt or their own evaluation criteria.

Step 3: Body
Managing technical debt is tricky—especially with the endless options for languages, frameworks, and AI tooling.

Whenever I'm deciding what to use for a new project, I focus on two things:

1) My experience with the language or library
The less I know a stack, the more I risk hacky solutions or duct-tape fixes that pile up as ""debt.""

2) How many times I need to run the project
If it'll only run once, it's fine to take shortcuts. If it's a core tool, every shortcut now is a headache later.

Being honest with myself about these two helps me balance ""move fast"" with ""don't sabotage future me.""

Step 4: CTA

Step 5: Hook Directions
A. [Problem/solution] — “Tech debt sneaks up on every AI project. Here’s how I avoid it.”
B. [Personal framing] — “Here are the 2 things I always ask before picking a stack for any AI build.”
C. [Relatability/challenge] — “The fastest way to sabotage an AI project? Ignore these 2 debt traps.”
D. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] — “Before you write a line of code, ask these 2 questions to avoid tech debt.”
E. [User’s own] — “Managing technical debt when coding with AI.”

Step 5B: Notes
A. Could focus on “sneaky” nature of debt + my antidote.
B. “Always ask myself” language = approachable, honest.
C. “Sabotage” = urgent, gives advice angle.
D. “Before you code, ask…” = actionable.
E. Matches user, less punchy.

Direction B is strongest: It’s personal, approachable, and direct.

Final Hook: Before I pick a stack for any AI project, I run through 2 key questions.

Step 6: Draft Full Post
Before I pick a stack for any AI project, I run through 2 key questions.

Managing technical debt is never fun, but with so many tools and frameworks out there, it’s easy to accidentally set yourself up for headaches down the line.

Here’s what I focus on when choosing languages or libraries:

1) My experience with the language/library
The less I know it, the more likely I’ll patch things together and regret it later.

2) How many times I'll need to run the project
If it’s a one-and-done job, I can cut corners. But if this tool sticks around, debt compounds fast.

Sticking to these two checks helps me move quickly—without making life harder for “future me.”

Purpose: Educate and inspire by sharing the lesser-discussed requirements for becoming a data entrepreneur. 
Audience: Aspiring data entrepreneurs, solo founders, tech professionals considering entrepreneurship, and AI practitioners who want to transition into building their own businesses.

Step 2: Post Wireframe
- Hook: ""15 things I had to learn to become a (data) entrepreneur""
- Meat: Short bullets for each skill with a line or two of Shaw’s perspective/honest reflection where natural
- CTA: What would you add to this list?

Step 3: Body/Meat
- Identify real pain points (not just fun ideas or cool projects)
- Code (not just copy/paste; building and troubleshooting)
- Leverage AI tools for speed and insight
- Sell: ask for money, handle objections, close deals
- Talk to real clients to understand their world
- Write clearly (whether emails, proposals, or documentation)
- Make a website that isn’t embarrassing
- Make content that helps—not just sells
- Do cold outreach (most of it will flop)
- Post online, even if nobody’s watching
- Look foolish, especially in public
- Constantly learn to stay sharp

Step 5: Hook Directions
5A: Labeled directions:
- [User’s own phrasing] 15 things I had to learn to become a (data) entrepreneur
- [Problem/solution] Nobody teaches you this in coding bootcamps or data science grad programs
- [Personal] I had to learn all these by trial and error—here’s my list
- [Numbers/list] 15 things nobody tells you...
- [Beginner-to-expert] The underrated skills that actually matter

5B: Notes
- User’s own phrasing is clear and attention-grabbing
- Problem/solution makes it relatable
- Personal struggles = humility/approachability
- “Beginner-to-expert” could quickly clarify for newbies

5C: Choosing direction: User’s own phrasing (direct and list-focused) is strongest and most in Shaw’s style. 

Final Hook: 15 things I had to learn to become a (data) entrepreneur (that nobody teaches you)

[""5 Tips for Building AI systems That Are Useless and Forgotten""]

Want to guarantee your AI project is ignored, abandoned, and forgotten?

Just follow these simple anti-patterns:

1. Spend no time on data curation
2. Assume your data quality is good (without looking)
3. Only train one version of your model
4. Focus more on using new tech over the business problem
5. Don’t worry about evals until you’re ready to push to prod

These habits will save you time in the short run—but almost always guarantee your system is useless in the long run.

Real talk: The path to an impactful AI system starts with sweat on the data, focus on business needs, and constant iteration and evals (way before deployment).

Which one of these have you seen most in real projects?

Step 7: Review for style, voice, flow
- Tone is clear, slightly cheeky but keeps to Shaw's style
- Only one em dash (reviewed)
- No specific claims about Shaw's own experience

[Body]
- Open with the mistake: chasing consulting projects when the real goal was building products.

Consulting brought in short-term wins, but left me with less time and focus for developing tools and solutions I wanted to ship.

So I changed my approach. Now:
- I offer free AI consults to the kind of customers I want to serve
- I turn these conversations into content
- The content brings in more calls
- From the calls, I build targeted prototypes
- I get hands-on feedback from real users
- Then I share the process (and lessons) publicly

And then—I repeat.

1. [User’s original phrasing] ""My biggest mistake: pursuing AI consulting when my goal was to develop products.""
2. [Problem/solution] The dangers of chasing quick wins over long-term product focus.
3. [Personal story] How chasing consulting clients slowed actual product development.
4. [Results/outcomes] Adjusting strategy: turning consults into products.
5. [Misconception] Most think consulting = market insight, but it can also become a distraction.

Here’s what I do differently now:
- Offer free AI consultations to my target customers

This cycle keeps me in touch with customer pain points, and focused on shipping solutions—not just delivering advice.

What’s one mistake you’ve made that changed your approach to building in AI?

Step 7: Review style/voice/flow
- Only one em dash (justified)
- No repeated phrases or rehashing hook
- Honest, self-aware tone
- Bullets: clear, actionable
- Ends with single question

Step 8: Write final post","My biggest mistake: chasing AI consulting projects instead of building products. (Here’s the process that fixed it.)

For a while, I pursued AI consulting gigs—even though what I really wanted was to develop my own products. It felt productive, but the truth is: I was building momentum in the wrong direction. Consulting brought short-term wins, but took my time and focus away from the tools and solutions I wanted to ship.

Here’s how I changed my approach:
- Offer free AI consultations to the customers I want to serve
- Turn each call into content (LinkedIn posts, blogs, videos)
- Content brings in more calls
- From those calls, I build quick prototypes based on real problems
- Get targeted feedback from actual users
- Share the learnings publicly
- Repeat

This cycle keeps me close to the problems I care about—and focused on building, not just advising.

5 Resume Myths That Kept Me Unemployed

1. More is better
Cramming in every detail makes your resume overwhelming. Pick the highlights that match the job instead.

2. I don’t need to tailor my resume
A generic resume is easy to ignore. Even small tweaks for each job raise your chances of getting noticed.

3. I need an objective statement
Recruiters rarely care about these. Ditch the objective and jump right into what you can deliver.

4. Writing down my experience is enough
Go beyond duties and show the outcomes you achieved. It’s about impact, not just activity.

If you’re in tech or design, a portfolio can set you apart fast. Even simple project links help.

Step 8: Final Post","5 Resume Myths That Kept Me Unemployed

Here are a few resume “rules” I wish I’d ignored sooner:

1. More is better
Packing your resume with every detail just makes it harder to read. Less (with focus) is more.

2. I don’t need to tailor my resume
One generic resume for every job? Recruiters can tell. Even small tweaks make a difference.

3. I need an objective statement
Most recruiters skip these. Lead with your wins and skills instead.

4. Writing down my experience is enough
Don’t just list what you did—show the value or results you delivered.

5. I don’t need a portfolio
If you’re in tech or design, a portfolio sets you apart in seconds. Real projects > buzzwords.

Data quality gets thrown around a lot in AI and data science, but it's not just a buzzword. At its core, 'data quality' usually boils down to two things:

1) Accuracy: How close is your data to the real truth? Are labels correct? Are there typos or mistakes? Poor accuracy leads to models that learn the wrong things.

2) Diversity: Does your data cover the full range of situations and examples you're likely to face in the real world? If not, your model might work great in testing but fail completely with new data.
