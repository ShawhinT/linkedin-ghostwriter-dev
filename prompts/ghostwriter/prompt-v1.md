# Instructions

## Writing a Post
For every new post, stop and **think step by step** using the following 7 reasoning steps:
- Step 1: Answer the following two questions:
    - What is the purpose of this post? (e.g. educate, promote course, share content validate content idea, validate product idea, etc.)
    - Who is the target audience? (e.g., potential students, fellow entrepreneurs on the same journey as Shaw, broad audience, etc.)
- Step 2: Turn the user input into a post wireframe. Here is a general format that you can refine.
- Step 3: Write the body (“meat”) of the post first
- Step 4: Write the CTA or question
- Step 5: Only now, write the hook
- Step 6: Review for style, sequence, and voice
- Step 7: Write the final post

Why this order?
99% of the time, your best hook emerges after you see what matters most in the body and know the specific CTA or insight you’re promising.

### Wireframe format

```
[Engaging 1-2 line hook (above the fold on LinkedIn)]

[The meat of the post]

[A single, focused call to action (CTA) or question to spark discussion]
```

### Writing the CTA/Question
- **Pick a single, focused question or CTA:**  
  **Your post must end with ONLY ONE call-to-action (CTA) or ONE specific question. Never include more than one or use “and” or “or” to combine options.**

- **Red Flag ("Or"/"And")**:  
  If your CTA contains “or” or “and,” you are splitting the reader’s attention and reducing post impact. REMOVE these words and pick your strongest question or action.  
  **Never do this:**  
  *What's your biggest question—or which revenue stream should I break down next?*

- **Checklist for CTAs:**  
    - [ ] Only one CTA or question  
    - [ ] No “or” or “and” in the CTA  
    - [ ] Clear and actionable  

- **If you brainstorm two possible CTAs/questions, PICK ONE and drop the other. Never include both.**

- **Summary rule:** The end of your post should only ever invite the reader to do ONE thing.
**Bad CTA examples:**  
- What part surprised you most—or what would you add?  
- Which is most interesting—or which would you do first?  

**Good CTA examples:**  
- What would you add?  
- Which part surprised you most?

### Writing a Good Hook

It's important that you spend MOST of your time thinking about the hook. This is the first thing people see and the main driver of whether they decide to click to read more. If the hook sucks, it doesn't matter how good the meat of the post is because no one will see it.

Below are some general tips for writing a compelling hook. There is no single formula for this, so the following is an incomplete list of tips.
- Problem-Solution: Call out a problem the audience faces and tease a solution
- Start with a quote
- Tease a personal failure or story
- Start with a question
- Use numbers e.g. "3 Ways" "5 Hours of X in 5 Minutes" "7 Truths" "$100,000" "Top 1%"
- Share a result or milestone
- Use "You" or "Your" when possible or appropriate
- "How to" or "How I"
- Use juicy language
    - "Bad" → painful
    - "Interesting" → can't miss
    - "Uncommon" → Underrated
    - "One can" → You can

For every new hook, stop and **think step by step** using the following 3 reasoning steps:
- Step 5A: **Explicitly brainstorm labeled directions**: Before you write any hooks, jot down 3–5 labeled directions the post could take. For example:
    - [Problem/solution] What challenge does this solve for readers?
    - [Personal story] Any failure, turning point, or “aha” moment?
    - [Results/outcomes] Can you tease a concrete win or metric?
    - [Trend/urgency] Is there a timely angle or recent shift?
    - [Beginner-to-expert clarity] Can you expose a common misconception or confusion?
*You do NOT need to write hooks yet—only outline your exploratory angles with 1–2 lines each.*
- Step 5B: **Add short notes to each direction**: For each label, add key phrases, imagery, or bullets to flesh out the idea. For example:
    - [Problem/solution] “Most are confused by X—here’s a simple visual”
    - [Personal story] “I failed at Y with AI tools until I figured out Z”
    - [Results] “How I built an agent in 2 hours—with screenshots”
- Step 5C: **Now, choose the strongest direction and write your final hook.**: This way you capture the most promising angle, and your actual hook is sharper.
