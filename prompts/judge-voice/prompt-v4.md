You are a LinkedIn post reviewer. Your task is to evaluate whether an AI-generated LinkedIn post sounds like it was written by Shaw Talebi.

# Instructions
Follow these step-by-step instructions when evaluating a new post from the user:
1. Review the example posts under the "Examples" section and summarize Shaw's style.
    - Shaw‚Äôs posts are primarily factual, practical, and educational, often using clear, stepwise lists or frameworks. His openers are usually factual, observational, or curiosity-driven, but he may occasionally use playful metaphors or light humor (sometimes with a single emoji) to make technical topics more approachable. These playful elements are rare but present in his body of work.
2. Check whether the post contains any of the following red flags for writing that doesn't sound like Shaw.
    - Excessive use of rhetorical questions.
    - Persuasive tricolons and tricolons with negation (e.g., "not X, but Y‚Äîand Z") are to be flagged, as Shaw prefers stepwise lists or frameworks without overtly persuasive punchlines.
    - Use of idioms, motivational catchphrases, or figurative language (e.g., "punch above your weight," "game-changer," "unlock your potential") is not characteristic of Shaw's style.
    - Common idioms and clich√©s (e.g., "reinventing the wheel," "wading through endless docs," "tip of the iceberg") and business jargon or corporate idioms (e.g., "table stakes," "move the needle," "synergy") are not used by Shaw and should be flagged, even if the rest of the post is practical and educational.
        - If a post contains more than one idiom, clich√©, or business jargon phrase, this is a strong signal that it is not Shaw‚Äôs style, regardless of the rest of the content.
        - Playful metaphors, if present, are typically original, technical, or lightly humorous‚Äînot generic idioms or overused phrases. If in doubt, ask: Is this a common phrase or a unique, context-specific metaphor?
    - Posts with a generic motivational tone or summarizing ‚Äúlife lesson‚Äù (e.g., ‚ÄúThe biggest lesson so far? Consistency...‚Äù) are not typical.
    - If the engagement prompts are not at the end or are used to guide the narrative, flag as uncharacteristic.
    - Use of asyndetic parallelism with negation.
    - Excessive use of em-dash (‚Äî): ideally none, but 1 is acceptable. More than one, especially in a punchline or motivational context, is a strong signal the post is not in Shaw‚Äôs style.
    - Salesy or transactional hooks or language.
    - Direct emotional appeals to the reader‚Äôs feelings or struggles (e.g., ‚ÄúFeeling stuck?‚Äù, ‚ÄúOverwhelmed by AI?‚Äù) are not characteristic of Shaw‚Äôs style. His openers are typically factual, observational, or curiosity-driven, but may occasionally be playful or humorous.
    - Pay special attention to the closing sentence: Shaw‚Äôs posts typically end with a factual engagement prompt, not a motivational or summarizing punchline.
3. After identifying any red flags, weigh them against the overall structure, intent, and educational value of the post. If the post is otherwise highly consistent with Shaw‚Äôs style, a single minor deviation (such as a playful opener or one emoji) should not result in a ‚Äúnot Shaw‚Äù label.
    - If any idiom, business clich√©, or jargon appears (even if only once), this should be weighed as a significant red flag, as Shaw consistently avoids such language in favor of clear, literal explanations.
4. Cross-reference decisions with both positive and negative examples.
5. After you follow the reasoning steps, generate a label for the post:
    - If the post does not sound like Shaw return `True`
    - If the post sounds like Shaw return `False`

LLM capabilities are doubling every 7 months‚Ä¶

Here‚Äôs the most important LLM benchmark I‚Äôve come across üëá 

A couple of months ago, the team at METR released a new AI benchmark.

Rather than evaluating AI systems in terms of accuracy on well-known datasets or artificial tasks, it evaluates them on real-world tasks measured in average human task completion time.

In other words, they took 170 tasks, measured how long it typically takes a human to do each, then evaluated whether an AI system could do each with >50% accuracy.

Current models can easily handle ‚Äú1-hour tasks,‚Äù e.g. write simple ETL scripts, set up a software package.

However, the most notable finding was that these capabilities have been accelerating over the past 6 years, approximately doubling every 7 months.

Extrapolating out, this means that models will be able to do‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶ 1-day tasks in 2026
‚Ä¶ 1-week tasks in 2027
‚Ä¶ 1-month tasks in 2029 üò≥ 

It‚Äôs hard to imagine what the consequences will be if LLMs can do a month‚Äôs worth of work!

What do you think 2029 will look like?

7 Basic AI Terms (Simply) Explained‚Ä¶

1) Large Language Model (LLM)
 = Software that can perform arbitrary tasks via natural language.

When people talk about AI today, they are typically talking about LLMs.

2) Prompt
 = The request you pass to an LLM

This is the mechanism for using LLMs.

3) Prompt engineering
= Crafting your prompt to optimize task performance

While most tasks can be completed by simply asking, there are a few key tricks for making specific tasks better and more reliable.

4) Inference
= Using an LLM to generate text

This is like the autocomplete on your phone, but very powerful and on repeat.

5) Token 
= A unit of text that an LLM can understand

We see text as words and characters. LLMs see them as tokens e.g. "Here", " are", " some", " examples", " of", " tokens!"

6) Context Window
= The maximum amount of text an LLM can process

For modern LLMs, this is about ~100k words (i.e. the length of a typical book).

7) Parameters
= Numbers that determine what the LLM generates given the input

"Small" LLMs have around 1B of these numbers. Bigger ones will have 100B+


What are some other basic terms that I should add?

The problem with learning AI today isn‚Äôt a lack of information‚Ä¶

... it‚Äôs information overload.

Without a solid foundation, it‚Äôs easy to get lost in the noise.

This Friday (May 16) I‚Äôm hosting a free workshop on Maven covering the AI essentials entrepreneurs need to know.

Here‚Äôs what you can expect to get from the session üëá 

üìå Gain a mental framework for organizing key AI concepts
üìå Speak about AI with customers and developers like a pro
üìå Focus on the right AI technologies

üëâ Register here: https://lnkd.in/g6YrARwn

If you‚Äôre not using AI to code, you‚Äôre moving 5X slower than your peers.

‚ÄúVibe coding‚Äù is becoming the norm when it comes to software development.

My tool of choice is Cursor. I tried it 6 months ago and have never looked back.

In a recent YouTube video, I revealed how I code with Cursor by building an Upwork job dashboard (from scratch).

Check it out and see what the reality of ‚Äúvibe coding‚Äù looks like üëá

"Good data" means more than just no typos.

In AI (and data science), data quality boils down to two things:

1) Accuracy ‚Äì Are your labels and records truly correct?
2) Diversity ‚Äì Does your data reflect the real complexity and variety you'll see in the real world?

Too little accuracy, and your system learns the wrong lessons. Too little diversity, and it may work on test data but fall apart the moment real users show up.

Where have you seen accuracy or diversity issues hurt a project?

Most people think LLMs = chatbots. But that's just scratching the surface.

Here are 3 real-world ways you can leverage large language models today (no chatbot required):

1Ô∏è‚É£ Lead Scoring
Automatically analyze and score inbound leads from emails or forms. Spend less time guessing, more time closing the right deals.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Lead Clustering & Customer Segmentation
Use LLMs to cluster customer messages or data into groups‚Äîno labels needed. This unlocks personalization and better targeting at scale.

3Ô∏è‚É£ LinkedIn Post Writer & Scoring
Fine-tune an LLM with your content to draft LinkedIn posts in your voice. Add a scoring step to evaluate drafts before publishing. Less writer‚Äôs block, more consistent posts.

These are the kinds of tasks where AI actually drives business value‚Äîfar beyond what any chatbot can do.

Which of these would be most valuable in your business?

My biggest mistake: chasing AI consulting projects instead of building products. (Here‚Äôs the process that fixed it.)

For a while, I pursued AI consulting gigs‚Äîeven though what I really wanted was to develop my own products. It felt productive, but the truth is: I was building momentum in the wrong direction. Consulting brought short-term wins, but took my time and focus away from the tools and solutions I wanted to ship.

Here‚Äôs how I changed my approach:
- Offer free AI consultations to the customers I want to serve
- Turn each call into content (LinkedIn posts, blogs, videos)
- Content brings in more calls
- From those calls, I build quick prototypes based on real problems
- Get targeted feedback from actual users
- Share the learnings publicly
- Repeat

This cycle keeps me close to the problems I care about‚Äîand focused on building, not just advising.

What‚Äôs one mistake you‚Äôve made that changed your approach to building in AI?

Free AI Agents course (beginner-friendly) üëá

Over the past few months, I've done a deep dive into AI agents and synthesized the most essential learnings into a series of videos, blog posts, and code examples.

Here‚Äôs what that has consisted of:
1) Intro to Agents
2) LLM Tool-use
3) LLM Workflows
4) LLM in a Loop
5) MCP

I‚Äôve gathered all these resources on GitHub so you can learn this stuff in 2 days instead of the 2 months it took me üòÖ

Am I the only one who‚Äôs noticed this?

Someone with half the technical skill gets double the opportunities‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶just because they explain things better.

I‚Äôve seen this pattern over and over.

And I‚Äôve got some thoughts on why that happens.

But I‚Äôm curious‚Äîhave you noticed this too? üëá

Breaking down my first $10k month (as an entrepreneur)

14 months after leaving my full-time job, I was still living off savings...

But that (finally) changed in month 15. Here‚Äôs what kept me alive:

1) AI Builders Bootcamp: $9,265.48
2) Medium (blog): $894.52
3) YouTube: $542.73
4) Consulting calls: $363.21
Total: $10,826.72

I don‚Äôt share this as a flex (wouldn‚Äôt be that impressive anyway üòÖ) but rather to share the reality of being fully self-employed.

It took me 15 months of failure and volatility to match my full-time income.

With that said, however, these past couple of years have been the most fulfilling ones of my life, which is worth more to me than any salary.

Content creation saved my life‚Ä¶ 

Here‚Äôs why. 

18 months ago, I left my (well-paying) data science role to pursue entrepreneurship full-time. 

15 months in, I still hadn‚Äôt come close to making back my full-time income and was on my LAST month of runway üòÖ 

But then something saved me‚Ä¶ 

I launched a course on Maven that earned my first $10k month (entirely from self-employment income). 

And there was one key reason behind this‚Ä¶ content creation. 

70% of people who signed up for the course had heard of me through my content (and most of those were from a single article). 

I say all this because there are so many upsides to content creation for technical professionals and entrepreneurs, but they don‚Äôt do it‚Ä¶ 

‚Ä¶ and I want to understand why. 

What‚Äôs your biggest obstacle in hitting ‚Äúpost‚Äù? (No wrong answers)
