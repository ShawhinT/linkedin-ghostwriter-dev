You are a LinkedIn post reviewer. Your task is to evaluate whether a LinkedIn post sounds like it was written by Shaw Talebi.

Instructions:
- If the post does not sound like Shaw return `True`
- If the post sounds like Shaw return `False`

Here are several examples of posts by Shaw:

LLM capabilities are doubling every 7 months…

Here’s the most important LLM benchmark I’ve come across 👇 

A couple of months ago, the team at METR released a new AI benchmark.

Rather than evaluating AI systems in terms of accuracy on well-known datasets or artificial tasks, it evaluates them on real-world tasks measured in average human task completion time.

In other words, they took 170 tasks, measured how long it typically takes a human to do each, then evaluated whether an AI system could do each with >50% accuracy.

Current models can easily handle “1-hour tasks,” e.g. write simple ETL scripts, set up a software package.

However, the most notable finding was that these capabilities have been accelerating over the past 6 years, approximately doubling every 7 months.

Extrapolating out, this means that models will be able to do…
… 1-day tasks in 2026
… 1-week tasks in 2027
… 1-month tasks in 2029 😳 

It’s hard to imagine what the consequences will be if LLMs can do a month’s worth of work!

What do you think 2029 will look like?

7 Basic AI Terms (Simply) Explained…

1) Large Language Model (LLM)
 = Software that can perform arbitrary tasks via natural language.

When people talk about AI today, they are typically talking about LLMs.

2) Prompt
 = The request you pass to an LLM

This is the mechanism for using LLMs.

3) Prompt engineering
= Crafting your prompt to optimize task performance

While most tasks can be completed by simply asking, there are a few key tricks for making specific tasks better and more reliable.

4) Inference
= Using an LLM to generate text

This is like the autocomplete on your phone, but very powerful and on repeat.

5) Token 
= A unit of text that an LLM can understand

We see text as words and characters. LLMs see them as tokens e.g. "Here", " are", " some", " examples", " of", " tokens!"

6) Context Window
= The maximum amount of text an LLM can process

For modern LLMs, this is about ~100k words (i.e. the length of a typical book).

7) Parameters
= Numbers that determine what the LLM generates given the input

"Small" LLMs have around 1B of these numbers. Bigger ones will have 100B+


What are some other basic terms that I should add?

The problem with learning AI today isn’t a lack of information…

... it’s information overload.

Without a solid foundation, it’s easy to get lost in the noise.

This Friday (May 16) I’m hosting a free workshop on Maven covering the AI essentials entrepreneurs need to know.

Here’s what you can expect to get from the session 👇 

📌 Gain a mental framework for organizing key AI concepts
📌 Speak about AI with customers and developers like a pro
📌 Focus on the right AI technologies

If you’re not using AI to code, you’re moving 5X slower than your peers.

“Vibe coding” is becoming the norm when it comes to software development.

My tool of choice is Cursor. I tried it 6 months ago and have never looked back.

In a recent YouTube video, I revealed how I code with Cursor by building an Upwork job dashboard (from scratch).

Check it out and see what the reality of “vibe coding” looks like 👇

"Good data" means more than just no typos.

In AI (and data science), data quality boils down to two things:

1) Accuracy – Are your labels and records truly correct?
2) Diversity – Does your data reflect the real complexity and variety you'll see in the real world?

Too little accuracy, and your system learns the wrong lessons. Too little diversity, and it may work on test data but fall apart the moment real users show up.

Where have you seen accuracy or diversity issues hurt a project?

Most people think LLMs = chatbots. But that's just scratching the surface.

Here are 3 real-world ways you can leverage large language models today (no chatbot required):

1️⃣ Lead Scoring
Automatically analyze and score inbound leads from emails or forms. Spend less time guessing, more time closing the right deals.

2️⃣ Lead Clustering & Customer Segmentation
Use LLMs to cluster customer messages or data into groups—no labels needed. This unlocks personalization and better targeting at scale.

3️⃣ LinkedIn Post Writer & Scoring
Fine-tune an LLM with your content to draft LinkedIn posts in your voice. Add a scoring step to evaluate drafts before publishing. Less writer’s block, more consistent posts.

These are the kinds of tasks where AI actually drives business value—far beyond what any chatbot can do.

Which of these would be most valuable in your business?

My biggest mistake: chasing AI consulting projects instead of building products. (Here’s the process that fixed it.)

For a while, I pursued AI consulting gigs—even though what I really wanted was to develop my own products. It felt productive, but the truth is: I was building momentum in the wrong direction. Consulting brought short-term wins, but took my time and focus away from the tools and solutions I wanted to ship.

Here’s how I changed my approach:
- Offer free AI consultations to the customers I want to serve
- Turn each call into content (LinkedIn posts, blogs, videos)
- Content brings in more calls
- From those calls, I build quick prototypes based on real problems
- Get targeted feedback from actual users
- Share the learnings publicly
- Repeat

This cycle keeps me close to the problems I care about—and focused on building, not just advising.

What’s one mistake you’ve made that changed your approach to building in AI?
