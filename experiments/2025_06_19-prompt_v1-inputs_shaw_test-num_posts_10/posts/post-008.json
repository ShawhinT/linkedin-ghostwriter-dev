  "writing_steps": "Step 1: \n- Purpose: Educate and inspire aspiring data entrepreneurs by sharing the hard-earned lessons required to transition from coder to entrepreneur.\n- Target Audience: Aspiring solopreneurs, data professionals, tech folks considering entrepreneurship, and those interested in building AI/data businesses.\n\nStep 2: Post wireframe:\n[Hook]\n[List: 15 things I had to learn]\n[Brief insight on why it matters – humility/real learning]\n[CTA: What's the one skill you're working on right now?]\n\nStep 3: Body\nMost people think being a \"data entrepreneur\" is all about technical skills. That’s maybe 25% of the job. Here are 15 things I had to learn (the hard way):\n\n- How to spot real pain points (not just interesting data problems)\n- Coding beyond tutorials (to build solutions that solve actual business problems)\n- Effectively use AI tools for speed and leverage\n- How to sell—even when it feels uncomfortable\n- Talking to clients (listening, not just pitching)\n- Writing clear ideas (for proposals, content, and product docs)\n- Building simple websites that actually convert\n- Making content people want to consume\n- Cold outbound (emails/DMs that get replies)\n- Just posting—before it feels \"ready\" or \"perfect\"\n- Looking foolish & embracing feedback\n- Constant learning (never \"done\")\n- Prioritizing: choosing what actually matters each day\n- Navigating uncertainty (no roadmaps in entrepreneurship)\n- Doing it all again tomorrow\n\nMost of these are learn-by-doing. You don’t need to have every piece in place before you start. But the sooner you get comfortable looking silly and selling—not just solving technical puzzles—the better.\n\nStep 4: CTA / question\nWhat’s the #1 skill you’re working on right now?\n\nStep 5: Hook directions:\nA. [Problem/Solution] “Most data professionals get stuck on step 1. Here’s what I wish I knew.\"\nB. [Personal story] “I thought being a good coder was enough. I was wrong (here’s why).”\nC. [List/Numbers] “15 skills I had to learn to become a data entrepreneur.”\nD. [Beginner-to-expert] “Coding is just 25% of data entrepreneurship—the rest is…?”\nE. [Confession/Transparency] “I messed up a lot before I got these 15 things right.”\n\nStep 5B: Short notes:\nA. People don’t realize how many hats you wear.\nB. Focus on my own naive start (coding!), reveal the rest.\nC. List format always grabs attention.\nD. Exposes misconception for aspiring entrepreneurs.\nE. Make it relatable through real struggle.\n\nStep 5C: Strongest direction: C – list/number hook—it’s direct, matches the post, and sets the reader up for scan-friendly value.\n\nStep 6: Review for voice/style:\n- Approachable, reflective, hints of humility.\n- White space & bullet points for readability.\n- Honest about the messiness (\"looking foolish\").\n- Ends on a genuine, actionable question.\n\nStep 7: Final post below:",
