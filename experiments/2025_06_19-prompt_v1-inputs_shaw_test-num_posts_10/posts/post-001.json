  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Share content (video) and validate interest in Shaw's preferred AI dev setup tools. It also serves to educate peers or students on assembling a clean dev stack from scratch.\n- Audience: Fellow AI developers, technical founders, students or aspiring indie hackers looking to optimize their own dev environment.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n---\n[Engaging hook]\n\n[Share why a good setup matters, walk through the 5 tools, and mention video resource.]\n\n[CTA: Ask for input or experience on dev setups.]\n---\n\nStep 3: Body (Meat)\nYour dev environment is the foundation of every project. I rebuilt mine from scratch to stay fast, reproducible, and focused on shipping AI projects.\n\nHere’s my clean-slate stack:\n- Xcode: Core for macOS dev tools\n- Homebrew: Installs everything else in seconds\n- Python: Still the backbone for AI and scripting\n- GitHub CLI: Manage repos and PRs from terminal\n- Cursor: Lightweight, AI-augmented coding\n\nI walk through it all in this quick video (with tips for each step).\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhat tool can you not live without in your AI dev setup?\n\nStep 5: Brainstorm Hooks (Step 5A):\n- [Beginner-to-Expert clarity] “Setting up AI dev environment from scratch? Here’s the stack I never skip.”\n- [Trend/urgency] “If you want to ship AI projects faster, your setup matters even more in 2024.”\n- [Personal story] “I rebuilt my dev environment from scratch this week—here’s my streamlined stack.”\n- [Problem/solution] “Most AI devs overcomplicate their setup. Here’s a simple stack that works.”\n- [Results/outcomes] “Building AI products? Here’s my lightweight, reproducible stack (with video).”\n\nStep 5B: Notes on Each Hook\n- Clarity: Lean, reproducible stack, no nonsense\n- Urgency: Staying fast & nimble, competitive edge\n- Story: Personal reset, why each piece matters\n- Problem: Over-complication = lost speed/focus\n- Results: You can build real stuff NOW\n\nStep 5C: Choose strongest: Let’s go with the personal story angle. “I rebuilt my dev environment from scratch this week—here’s my streamlined stack.”\n\nStep 6: Review for style, sequence, and voice\n- Approachable, transparent, clear\n- Personal experience with universal takeaways\n- Bulleted/visual stack, strong CTA\n\nStep 7: Write Final Post",
