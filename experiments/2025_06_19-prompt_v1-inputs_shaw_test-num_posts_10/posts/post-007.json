  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Educate peers about the (often overlooked) non-technical skills critical for data/AI entrepreneurs; validate content idea by sharing real lessons.\n- Audience: Aspiring/current data entrepreneurs, technical founders branching out, solo/early-stage consultants in AI/ML.\n\nStep 2: Post Wireframe\n- Hook: “You need more than Python to survive as a data entrepreneur.”\n- Meat: List the 10 non-technical skills, offer brief commentary about why each matters, include honest reflection (e.g., ‘these surprised me’ or ‘I struggled with X’).\n- CTA: “Which non-technical skill was hardest for you to learn?”\n\nStep 3: The Meat\nWhen I first jumped into building my own data consulting business, I thought technical chops were 90% of the job. Wrong.\n\nHere are 10 non-technical skills that ended up just as critical:\n\n1. Explaining technical ideas to non-technical people—most clients don’t care about your model, only the results.\n2. Talking to customers—if you can’t listen and learn their pain points, you’ll build the wrong thing.\n3. Formulating business problems—not every problem needs an ML solution. Translation is everything.\n4. Asking good questions—gets you to clarity (and fewer surprises).\n5. Validating product/service ideas—prevents months wasted building what no one wants.\n6. Responding to emails quickly—trust and deals hinge on basic communication.\n7. Sales—learned this by losing more deals than I’d like to admit.\n8. Warm outreach—my first 5 clients came from bold, friendly DMs—not cold spamming.\n9. Making a landing page—even a simple Notion/Super page can signal ‘real business’.\n10. Copywriting—if your message isn’t clear, expect confusion (even from friends).\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhich non-technical skill was hardest for you to learn?\n\nStep 5: Hook brainstorming\nA. [Problem/solution] “Most data founders focus on code. Here’s what they miss.”\nB. [Personal story] “I thought tech skills were enough. I was wrong.”\nC. [List/clarity] “10 Non-coding skills every data entrepreneur needs (but few talk about).”\nD. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “Building data products? These 10 skills matter more than your tech stack.”\nE. [Trend/urgency] “AI is everywhere, but these old-school skills still make or break your business.”\n\nNotes for each:\n- A: Common misconception\n- B: Honest, personal lesson\n- C: Inviting/focused on the list\n- D: Surprising shift—‘not your stack’\n- E: Current landscape—AI hype but fundamentals remain\n\nChosen: C (because the format is clear and speaks directly to pain point).\n\nFinal Hook: “10 non-technical skills you need to survive as a data entrepreneur (that no one prepares you for)” \n\nStep 6: Review for style & sequence\n- Clear, direct language\n- Mix of bullet points + commentary for each item\n- Honest, peer-to-peer tone\n- Ends with an engaging question\n\nStep 7: Final post ready below.",
