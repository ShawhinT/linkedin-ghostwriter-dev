  "writing_steps": "Step 1: \n- Purpose: To share a personal milestone (birthday) and recap Shaw’s growth/highlights from the past year with concrete numbers—building credibility, community, and inspiring others.\n- Audience: Broad audience—students, entrepreneurs, and Shaw’s online network (peers, followers).\n\nStep 2: Wireframe:\n[Hook: Unexpected/reflection about time/numbers/reality check]\n[Meat: Quick bullet list of metrics—growth, failures, wins, lessons]\n[Single CTA: Invite reader to reflect/share their year/ask a question]\n\nStep 3: Body:\nAnother birthday—another wild year on this journey.\n\nBy the numbers:\n- 12+ new videos published\n- 200k+ total views\n- 3 paid pilot clients\n- 4 new AI tools tested (and discarded)\n- 1 course launched (with bugs!)\n- 3 failed product experiments\n- 200+ DMs answered\n- 1 big lesson: consistency > perfection\n\nIt’s not all upward graphs. Most experiments flopped before anything worked. But every single lesson came from *doing*—not just planning.\n\nIf we only count the wins, we miss the story.\n\nStep 4: CTA/Question:\nWhat’s *your* number one lesson from this past year?\n\nStep 5: Hooks (Brainstorm directions):\nA. [Reflection] 365 days, hundreds of mistakes, one huge lesson…\nB. [Numbers/results] What a year looks like by the numbers (it’s not all wins)\nC. [Personal] I turned a year older today—here’s what really changed\nD. [Trend] Another year in AI—breakthroughs, breakdowns, and a few surprises\n\nNotes:\nA: Emphasizes failures and key lesson, invites vulnerability\nB: Focuses on concrete metrics, reality check—not pure success\nC: Draws in with a personal lens, “not just numbers”\nD: Taps into AI/industry trends, but less personal\n\nStep 6: Chosen direction and write hook:\nI’ll go with B: Numbers/results—teasing that it’s not all wins.\nFinal hook: \n“Another year older. Here’s what 12 months of building in public *really* looks like—by the numbers.”\n\nStep 7: Review:\n- Style: Honest, number-driven, candid\n- Sequence: Hook → data → reflection → lesson → CTA\n- Voice: Direct, shares wins and failures, invites reader\n",
