  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Share educational content and drive traffic to Shaw's new blog post. Establish authority on deploying ML with modern tools.\n- Audience: AI developers, data scientists, MLOps engineers, technical founders looking to deploy ML models easily.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n- Hook: Tease the pain of getting ML models “out of notebooks” and into production, and offer a practical guide.\n- Meat: Call out the challenge, mention the tools (FastAPI, Docker, GCP), preview the step-by-step guide and what readers will get, highlight actionability.\n- CTA: Invite to check out the blog for a full walkthrough.\n\nStep 3: Body\nGetting a machine learning model out of a notebook and into production can feel overwhelming. You need to handle APIs, containers, and cloud infrastructure—often without a clear playbook.\n\nThat’s why I put together a new step-by-step blog guide: how to deploy ML models using FastAPI (for the backend API), Docker (for repeatable containerization), and GCP (for scalable hosting).\n\nInside, you’ll find:\n- Why FastAPI is a go-to for Python-based APIs\n- How to Dockerize your ML pipeline\n- Deploying to Google Cloud Platform the simple way\n- Pro tips for debugging and keeping things running\n\nWhether you’re shipping your first model or leveling up your workflow, you’ll come away with a repeatable template you can use again and again.\n\nStep 4: CTA/Question\nRead the full step-by-step walkthrough here: [link]\n\nStep 5A: Brainstorm Hooks\n[Problem/solution] – “Struggling to move ML from notebook to production? Here’s a shortcut.”\n[Personal story] – “I remember fumbling through bad deployment guides—so I wrote the one I wish I had.”\n[Results/outcomes] – “Deploy your ML model in a single afternoon (with FastAPI, Docker, and GCP).”\n[Trend/urgency] – “More ML teams than ever are standardizing on this stack—are you?”\n[Beginner-to-expert clarity] – “Most guides skip key steps. Here’s every command I use.”\n\nStep 5B: Short Notes\n[Problem/solution] “Notebooks are easy—deployments aren’t; actionable deployment recipe”\n[Personal story] “Documented my own deployment workflow from scratch”\n[Results/outcomes] “Go from model to live API today”\n[Trend/urgency] “Cloud, Docker, FastAPI: modern stack for ML deployment”\n[Beginner-to-expert] “No skipped steps, full code, tips included”\n\nStep 5C: Pick direction\nI’ll go with the Problem/Solution angle because that speaks to the most common hurdle for the audience.\n\nStep 6: Style Review\n- Clear, direct, step-by-step teaching\n- Short paragraphs, list for key benefits\n- Friendly, humble peer tone\n\nStep 7: Final Post",
  "final_post": "Getting your ML model out of a Jupyter notebook and into the real world?\n\nThat’s where most projects stall.\n\nI’ve seen smart teams (myself included) waste weeks reinventing deployment, tangled up in APIs and configs. So I wrote the practical guide I wish I had: exactly how to deploy ML solutions using FastAPI, Docker, and GCP.\n\nIn this fresh blog post, you’ll learn:\n- Why FastAPI makes building APIs for ML dead simple\n- How to containerize your workflow with Docker (repeatably, reliably)\n- The basics of getting your project live on Google Cloud Platform\n- Debugging + maintenance tips I wish I knew earlier\n\nWhether you’re a solo builder or leveling up your team’s workflow, this guide covers every step—with code, config files, and tips that work in real life.\n\nGrab the full walk-through here: [link]"
