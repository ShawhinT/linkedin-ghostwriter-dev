  "writing_steps": "Step 1:\n- Purpose: Share a milestone (60k YouTube subs), reflect on the why (learning + communication), connect it to ongoing journey, subtly reinforce credibility, and invite conversation about learning/teaching.\n- Target audience: Fellow creators, learners, aspiring AI educators, solopreneurs, Shaw's broader audience who are interested in content creation and personal growth.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n- [Hook] Statement about the power of sharing what you learn or an insight about teaching/communicating on YouTube.\n- [Meat] Reflect on hitting 60k, why Shaw started: learning + communication. What the journey has taught him about these things. The impact of teaching others for his own growth.\n- [CTA] Invite readers to share how they use teaching/learning in their own journey.\n\nStep 3: Body/Meat\n60,000 subscribers isn’t just a number. It’s 60,000 different people who decided that learning out loud with me was worth their time.\n\nI started my channel because I noticed something simple: the best way to learn something deeply is to teach it. Every script, demo, and mistake has deepened my own understanding, while hopefully making complex ideas a little more clear for others.\n\nThis journey has taught me—again and again—that communication isn’t an add-on. It’s the bridge between curiosity and competence. The more I share what I’m figuring out, the faster I grow, and the more I connect with fascinating minds along the way.\n\nStep 4: CTA/Question\nHow has sharing what you’re learning shaped your own growth?\n\nStep 5: Hook\nStep 5A: Label directions for hook\n- [Problem/solution] Most people focus on what they know—few realize the power of sharing what you *don’t* know yet.\n- [Personal story] Before YouTube, I thought teaching was about answers. Turns out, it’s the best way to ask better questions.\n- [Results] 60,000 is a milestone—but the bigger win is how much I’ve learned by teaching.\n- [Trend/urgency] In an AI-filled world, communication is the skill that multiplies everything else.\n- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] Teaching isn’t the last step in learning—it’s the engine that drives it.\n\nStep 5B: Key phrases per direction:\n- [Problem/solution] “Sharing what you don’t yet know”\n- [Personal story] “I thought teaching was about answers…actually, it’s about better questions”\n- [Results] “60,000 proof points that teaching multiplies learning”\n- [Trend/urgency] “Communication is the multiplier in an AI world”\n- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “Teaching *is* how you learn”\n\nStep 5C: Choose and write the strongest hook\nTeaching isn’t what happens *after* you’ve learned something. It’s how you turn ideas into understanding—for yourself *and* others.\n\nStep 6: Review for style, sequence, and voice\n- Lead with the insight about teaching-as-learning\n- Share milestone and emotion without hype, focus on journey\n- Tie communication skill to content/career growth\n- End with question rooted in sharing/learning\n\nStep 7: Write the final post",
  "final_post": "Teaching isn’t what happens *after* you’ve learned something. It’s how you turn ideas into understanding—for yourself *and* others.\n\nHitting 60,000 YouTube subscribers is a milestone I’m proud of, but honestly, the real payoff has been how much teaching has accelerated my own learning.\n\nI started my channel because I wanted to get better at explaining complex ideas in AI and entrepreneurship. Every time I break down a topic, experiment with a tool, or fumble through a demo in public, I absorb the lessons at a deeper level—and hopefully make it easier for someone else, too.\n\nAt its core, learning and communication go hand in hand. Sharing what you know (and what you’re still figuring out) is the fastest way to improve, attract collaborators, and open new doors.\n\nHow has sharing what you’re learning shaped your own growth?"
