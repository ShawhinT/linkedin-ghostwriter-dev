What followed wasn’t the rocket ship I imagined—it was a face-first crash into the reality of entrepreneurship.\n\nMonth after month, I tinkered, shipped, failed, barely scraped by. The wins were small and rare. Honestly? I questioned if I’d made a giant mistake—more than once.\n\nBut this month, something clicked: I finally hit $10k+ in one month.
