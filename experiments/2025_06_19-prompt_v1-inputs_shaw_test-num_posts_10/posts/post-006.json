  "writing_steps": "Step 1:\n- Purpose: Educate readers on the key differences between corporate and freelance data science roles—help those considering a transition decide what’s best for them.\n- Target audience: Aspiring or current data scientists (especially those considering freelancing), career-switchers, technical professionals.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n- Hook: Contrasting corporate vs freelance data science—pose a direct question or tease a surprising insight.\n- Body: Breakdown of the primary differences, pros/cons, personal insights, and practical tips.\n- CTA/Question: Focused engagement question for readers—likely about their experience or which path appeals more.\n\nStep 3: Write the body first (the “meat” of the post)\n\nThinking about leaving your corporate data science role for freelancing—or vice versa? Here’s what I’ve learned:\n\nCorporate Data Science:\n- Stable salary & benefits 🏦\n- Bigger teams, clear roles, (often) more resources\n- Slower pace, bureaucracy, less flexibility\n- Opportunities for mentorship & deep specialization\n\nFreelance Data Science:\n- You’re the boss: pick projects, set your rates 💸\n- Varied work—new challenges, more autonomy\n- Feast or famine income (cash flow ups & downs)\n- Must wear every hat: sales, delivery, admin, upskilling\n\nWhat’s surprised me most? Freelancing grows your business skills fast—but sometimes, I miss having a team to bounce ideas off. Both paths can be lucrative and fulfilling, depending on what you want out of your career.\n\nStep 4: Write the CTA or question\nWhat’s been your biggest challenge switching between corporate and freelance—or which style are you leaning toward?\n\nReviewing Red Flag: This has “or”; pick ONE: e.g., “If you had to pick, which path suits you best?”\n\nREFINED CTA: Which path do you think suits you best—corporate or freelance?\n\nNo: Still an or. Let's pick: “Which path do you see yourself thriving in?”\n\nStep 5: Write the hook.\nStep 5A: Brainstorm labeled directions\n- [Problem/solution] “Thinking of leaving your 9–5 for freelance?”\n- [Personal story] “Why I left corporate for freelance data science (and what surprised me)”\n- [Comparison] “Corporate vs Freelance: The data science split no one talks about”\n- [Question] “Which would you choose: stability or autonomy?”\n- [Results] “Freelance data science taught me more (and scared me more) than any corporate job”\n\nStep 5B: Notes for each\n- [Problem/solution] Lots of people stuck deciding—need clarity\n- [Personal story] Can weave in a quick lesson/aha moment\n- [Comparison] Set up for a straight-up side-by-side contrast\n- [Question] Emphasizes trade-offs\n- [Results] Personal growth theme\n\nStep 5C: Pick strongest direction\nLet’s lead with a direct, scannable contrast: “Corporate vs Freelance: Here’s what most data scientists get wrong about both.”\n\nStep 6: Review for style, sequence, and voice\n- Concise, real, reflective. Simple breakdowns, actual reflections, and a clearly focused question at the end.\n- Use readable formatting and relatable language.\n\nStep 7: Write the final post.",
