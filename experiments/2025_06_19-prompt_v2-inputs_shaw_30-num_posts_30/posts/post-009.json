  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\nPurpose: Educate and promote a free guide (\"30 AI Projects You Can Build This Weekend\"). Show the range of project types possible in AI today and hint at the structure of the guide.\nTarget Audience: Aspiring AI builders, technical tinkerers, beginners-to-intermediates, and solo founders interested in practical AI projects.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n[Engaging 1-2 line hook (above the fold on LinkedIn)]\n[Short intro about the post and the free guide]\n[3 project categories: Software 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0, each with a sentence on scope]\n[Link to download/free guide access]\n[CTA: single focused question]\n\nStep 3: The Meat\n- Briefly introduce the free guide. Emphasize that it covers a spectrum: Software 1.0 (data analysis, pipelines), Software 2.0 (ML projects), Software 3.0 (prompt engineering, RAG, agents, fine-tuning).\n- Highlight that all projects are practical and can be done in a weekend.\n- Mention it's designed for those who want to build and learn by doing.\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhat type of AI project are you most excited to try: data analysis, ML, or 3.0 (prompting/agents)?\n\nStep 5: Hook Directions & Final Hook\nStep 5A: Brainstorm Hook Directions\n- [List Post/Numbers] \"30 AI projects you can build this weekend (with zero cost)\"\n- [Problem/Solution] \"Stuck staring at AI tutorials? Here are 30 hands-on projects you can finish in a weekend.\"\n- [Beginner-to-Expert Clarity] \"From classic data pipelines to AI agents — all in one free weekend guide.\"\n- [Trend/Levels] \"Software 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0: 30 real projects to help you master every phase of AI.\"\n- [User’s own phrasing] \"30 AI Projects You Can Build This Weekend (Free Guide)\"\nStep 5B: Add Short Notes\n- [List Post/Numbers] Emphasizes volume and speed, appeals to builder mindset.\n- [Problem/Solution] Overcomes analysis paralysis, positions guide as actionable.\n- [Beginner-to-Expert Clarity] Addresses confusion with AI project types, clarifies scope.\n- [Trend/Levels] Hooks with levels/tiers; appeals to those wanting structured growth.\n- [User’s own phrasing] Utilitarian, clear but less punchy than some options.\nStep 5C: Pick & Write Final Hook\n[Trend/Levels] “Software 1.0, 2.0, 3.0: 30 practical AI projects you can build this weekend (free guide)”\n\nStep 6: Draft Full Post\nSoftware 1.0, 2.0, 3.0: 30 practical AI projects you can build this weekend (free guide)\n\nOverwhelmed by the sheer number of AI tools out there? I put together a free resource with 30 hands-on projects you can actually build—no fluff:\n\n• Software 1.0: Classic data analysis and automation projects (think data pipelines, reporting dashboards).\n• Software 2.0: Core machine learning (training models, basic predictors, simple classifiers).\n• Software 3.0: All things LLM—prompt engineering, RAG workflows, building AI agents, even trying your hand at fine-tuning.\n\nEvery project is designed to be practical, approachable, and finishable in a weekend.\n\nGrab the free guide here: [link]\n\nWhich type of AI project are you most excited to try: classic analysis, machine learning, or agents/prompts?\n\nStep 7: Review for Style, Voice, Flow\n- No more than one em dash — passed.\n- Hook is clear and about the “levels”/types (good fit for audience).\n- Body outlines the three software “eras” in simple language.\n- CTA is one focused question.\n- Scannable and friendly.\n\nStep 8: Final Post",
