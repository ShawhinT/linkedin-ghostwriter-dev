  "input": "Breaking down my first $10k month (as an entrepreneur). Revenue sources and breakdown",
  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Educate and inspire by transparently sharing a first $10k month as an entrepreneur, showing the revenue breakdown and real sources so others can learn or benchmark.\n- Audience: Fellow entrepreneurs, solopreneurs, side hustlers, and anyone interested in building an independent business.\n\nStep 2: Post wireframe\n- Hook: Something attention-grabbing about the $10k milestone and transparency.\n- Body: Brief context (first $10k month), honest thoughts/feelings, bullet points or breakdown of revenue sources with percentages or dollar values, what worked/lessons, short reflection.\n- CTA: Invite readers to share their revenue sources or ask what surprised them most.\n\nStep 3: Body (“meat”)\nAfter months of effort, finally hit a $10k month. Felt both exciting and slightly surreal—because there’s no single silver bullet, just a mix of revenue streams working together.\nHere’s the honest breakdown:\n- Freelance AI consulting: $5,500\n- Online courses: $2,500\n- 1:1 coaching: $1,200\n- Product sales (templates/tools): $800\nThe lesson? Rarely does all come from just one source, especially early on. Diversifying helped smooth out ups and downs, and I learned just how much experimenting it really takes.\nIf you’re in the early stages: Don’t stress if your income is patchwork. That’s often the reality in the beginning.\n\nStep 4: CTA/question\nWhat’s the most surprising revenue source in your own business?\n\nStep 5A: Brainstorm hook directions\n- [Milestone/pride/celebration]: “Just hit my first $10k month as an entrepreneur.”\n- [Transparency/peeling back the curtain]: “Here’s exactly how I made my first $10k in a single month.”\n- [Reality check/common truth]: “Most entrepreneurs don’t talk about where their revenue *actually* comes from. Here’s my breakdown.”\n- [Lesson/learning]: “My biggest lesson from hitting $10k in a month? Diversification.”\n- [User’s own phrasing]: “Breaking down my first $10k month (as an entrepreneur). Revenue sources and breakdown.”\n\nStep 5B: Add notes to each direction\n- [Milestone/pride]: Sets tone of celebration, may spark positivity.\n- [Transparency]: Focus on openness, likely to get attention for honesty.\n- [Reality check]: Can challenge assumptions, lead to relatability.\n- [Lesson]: Makes it about what others can learn.\n- [User’s]: Direct, clear, matches user’s prompt.\n\nStep 5C: Choose strongest direction\n- “Transparency” direction works strongest—this kind of honest post performs well and fits Shaw’s style. Will blend user’s phrase for clarity.\nFinal Hook: “Here’s exactly how I made my first $10k as an entrepreneur (with real numbers).”\n\nStep 6: Draft full post\n[Hook]\nHere’s exactly how I made my first $10k as an entrepreneur (with real numbers).\n\n[Body]\nAfter months of steady building, I finally hit my first $10k month—not with one flashy win, but through a handful of revenue streams working together.\n\nHere’s the full breakdown:\n- Freelance AI consulting: $5,500\n- Online courses: $2,500\n- 1:1 coaching: $1,200\n- Product sales (templates/tools): $800\n\nThe biggest lesson? It’s rarely just one thing that gets you there—diversifying not only made this milestone possible, but helped smooth out the inevitable ups and downs.\n\nIf you’re still piecing together your own path, remember: a patchwork income isn’t a failure, it's almost always how the first real momentum happens.\n\n[CTA]\nWhat’s the most surprising revenue source in your own business?\n\nStep 7: Review for style, voice, and flow\n- Clear, direct, honest tone.\n- White space and bullet points for clarity.\n- Only one em dash (kept for emphasis in lesson).\n- CTA is single and specific.\n\nStep 8: Write final post",
