  "writing_steps": "Step 1:\n- Purpose: Educate beginners about a no-nonsense roadmap to start learning AI in 2025 (with an actionable path).\n- Target audience: Absolute beginners, career switchers, and self-learners interested in AI but unsure where to begin; also appeals to those mentoring newcomers.\n\nStep 2: Post wireframe\n[Hook: How I’d learn AI in 2025 if I started from zero]\n[Body: List practical steps required, with mini-explanations; avoid unnecessary fluff]\n[CTA: Single focused question to spark newcomers to comment]\n\nStep 3: The meat\nIf I was starting from scratch... Here’s the playbook I wish someone handed me:\n\n1. Use ChatGPT (or the like): Start asking all your AI questions here. Treat it as your personal tutor.\n2. Install Python: Learn the basics. You’ll use Python for almost everything in AI.\n3. Build an Automation (Beginner): Automate a boring task in your life (think: renaming files, summarizing notes).\n4. Build an ML Project (Intermediate): Train a simple machine learning model on a dataset—classifying emails or recognizing digits.\n5. Build a Real-world Project (Advanced): Solve a problem you actually care about (automated content, basic agent, or a web app).\n\nEvery step builds real confidence (not just theoretical knowledge).\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhich step would be hardest for you?\n\nStep 5A/B: Hook brainstorming directions\n- [User framing] \"How I’d learn AI in 2025 (if I knew nothing)\"\n- [Problem/solution] “Most beginners get stuck on the tools. Here’s a roadmap that works.”\n- [Personal story] “If I could start over in AI, I’d ignore most of the theory and do this instead.”\n- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “People overcomplicate AI—here’s a dead-simple, 5-step path.”\n- [Trend/urgency] “AI is moving fast. Here’s how to catch up as a complete beginner in 2025.”\nStep 5C: Chosen Hook: User's own phrasing wins for clarity—a direct invitation to see the whole roadmap from a clean slate.\n\nStep 6: Draft post\nHow I’d learn AI in 2025 (if I knew nothing)\n\nIf I was starting from scratch, here’s exactly what I’d do:\n\n1. Use ChatGPT (or something similar): Treat it as your personal tutor. Ask questions, get explanations, and iterate on your understanding in real-time.\n2. Install Python: Get comfortable writing and running basic code. Python is the language of AI—no way around it.\n3. Build an Automation (Beginner): Automate something boring in your life. Rename files, summarize PDFs, batch convert images—whatever feels immediately useful.\n4. Build a Machine Learning Project (Intermediate): Work with a real dataset. Classify emails, predict numbers, or do some basic image recognition.\n5. Build a Real-world Project (Advanced): Tackle something you genuinely want to use. Maybe an AI agent to manage to-dos, a chatbot for your website, or a content generator.\n\nEach step gives you more than just theory—it builds confidence by solving real problems.\n\nWhich step would be hardest for you?\n\nStep 7: Style, voice, and flow review\n- Tone: Clear, approachable, focuses on actionable steps\n- One em dash (acceptable, used for clarity)\n- Avoids hype and jargon\n- Invites practical engagement\n\nStep 8: Final post",
