  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Encourage and empower aspiring AI engineers or AI enthusiasts by demystifying how \"top\" practitioners achieve so much—through focusing on building, not simply intellect.\n- Audience: Aspiring AI engineers, learners, and early-career builders who may feel imposter syndrome or lack of confidence compared to \"top\" engineers.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n- Hook: A bold, myth-busting statement about top AI engineers\n- Meat: Elaborate that the key differentiator is that top engineers build more, not that they're naturally smarter, offering encouragement and a clear path\n- CTA: \"What are you building right now?\"\n\nStep 3: Body/Meat\nMost of the best AI engineers I’ve met aren’t magic outliers who were destined to succeed. They didn’t start out any smarter than their peers. The big difference? They build. Constantly.\n\nInstead of overthinking which model is best or waiting to \"feel ready,\" they:\n- Ship scrappy projects\n- Get real-world feedback\n- Iterate quickly\n\nYou don’t level up by reading every new paper or watching endless tutorials. You grow faster when you touch code, ship things, and see what breaks (and what works).\n\nYou don’t have to wait for permission or the “right” level of expertise. Start building now. That’s how everyone you admire did it.\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhat are you building right now?\n\nStep 5: Hooks (with brainstorming)\nA) [User’s own phrasing] Most top AI engineers aren’t more intelligent than you. They just do this one thing more… BUILD\nB) [Problem/solution] Feel stuck in tutorial land? The real \"unlock\" is shipping projects, not studying more.\nC) [Personal story] I used to think top engineers were just born smarter. Then I noticed what they all had in common: relentless building.\nD) [Trend/urgency] With AI moving this fast, those who build, win.\nE) [Beginner-to-expert clarity] You’re closer than you think. Top AI engineers just build more than they talk about it.\n\nStep 5B: Short notes:\nA) Lead with the user's line—direct, myth-busting\nB) Address analysis paralysis—action beats study\nC) Honest reflection on shifting mindset\nD) Urgency of building in fast-moving field\nE) Empowering perspective for beginners\n\nStep 5C: Chosen Hook—A) The user’s original is strong and bold. Hits Shaw’s approachable, myth-busting tone. Will use this with a slight structural tweak for impact.\n\nStep 6: Full Draft\nMost top AI engineers aren’t more intelligent than you.\n\nThey just do one thing more than everyone else:\nThey build. A lot.\n\nThe best engineers I’ve met weren’t born knowing the answers. They just kept showing up, shipping projects, and learning from what broke along the way.\n\nYou don’t need to wait until you “know enough.” You don’t level up by watching tutorials forever or reading every new paper. The fastest way to learn—and earn respect—is to build, publish, and iterate.\n\nSo, if you want to stand out, shift your focus from absorbing knowledge to creating with it.\n\nWhat are you building right now?\n\nStep 7: Review for Style, Voice, Flow\n- One em dash remains (acceptable for emphasis in \"learn—and earn respect\"; justified).\n- No repetition in hooks/first lines.\n- Clear line spacing and bullet points for readability.\n- Direct, empowering, action-oriented tone reflecting Shaw’s style.\n- Ends with a single, focused CTA.\n\nStep 8: Final Post",
