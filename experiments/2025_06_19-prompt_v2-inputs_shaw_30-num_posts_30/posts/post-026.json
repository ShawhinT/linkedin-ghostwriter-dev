  "input": "Share blog: Local LLM fine-tuning on Mac\n\nContext:\nThis article is part of a larger series on using large language models (LLMs) in practice. In a previous post, I showed how to fine-tune an LLM using a single (free) GPU on Google Colab. While that example (and many others) readily runs on Nvidia hardware, they are not easily adapted to M-series Macs. In this article, I walk through an easy way to fine-tune an LLM locally on a Mac.",
  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose and Audience\n- Purpose: Share and drive traffic to Shaw's new blog article showing how to fine-tune LLMs locally on a Mac, and situate it within a broader series on practical LLM usage.\n- Audience: Technical audience (practitioners, developers, learners) who want to fine-tune LLMs and especially those working with M-series Macs.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n- Hook: \"Most LLM fine-tuning guides skip over Macs\" / \"Fine-tuning LLMs on a Mac is easier than you think.\"\n- Meat: Context: Series on using LLMs in practice; prior post = Colab/Nvidia, but not easy on Macs. This installment: how to fine-tune LLMs locally on M-series Macs; easy workflow.\n- Link to blog.\n- CTA: \"Any questions about running LLMs locally on Mac?\"\n\nStep 3: Body\nMost tutorials for fine-tuning large language models expect Nvidia GPUs, which leaves Mac users (especially those with M-series chips) in a tough spot. My latest article tackles this problem head-on. If you've wanted to experiment with LLM fine-tuning without relying on Colab or cloud GPUs, this is for you. Step-by-step walkthrough, all on local Mac hardware.\n\nStep 4: CTA\nAny questions about running LLMs locally on Mac?\n\nStep 5: Hook Brainstorming\nA) [Problem/solution] – \"Most LLM fine-tuning guides skip Macs. Here’s how to do it locally.\"\nB) [Trend/urgency] – \"Apple Silicon is everywhere, but most AI tutorials are stuck on Nvidia.\"\nC) [Beginner-to-expert clarity] – \"You don’t need an Nvidia GPU to fine-tune LLMs.\"\nD) [User’s own phrasing] – \"An easy way to fine-tune an LLM locally on a Mac.\"\nE) [Personal story] – \"After struggling to adapt Colab guides to my Mac, I found a better approach.\"\n\nStep 5B: Notes\nA) \"If you have a Mac with an M chip, you can experiment, too.\"\nB) \"Apple adoption is high—people are blocked by Nvidia-only guides.\"\nC) \"Workflow for Mac users—simple and practical.\"\nD) Reiterates ease and Mac focus.\nE) Signaling first-person struggle and solution.\n\nStep 5C: Pick Direction\nA) Problem/solution: \"Most LLM fine-tuning guides skip Macs. Here’s how to do it locally.\"\n\nStep 6: Full Draft\nMost LLM fine-tuning guides skip Macs. Here’s how to do it locally.\n\nToo many LLM tutorials assume you have access to Nvidia GPUs—if you’re on a Mac (especially with an M-series chip), you’re often left out.\n\nIn my latest article, I break down an easy, step-by-step method to fine-tune LLMs using only your local Mac hardware. No Colab, no cloud GPUs required.\n\nIf you’re following my LLM-in-practice series, this post is a direct follow-up to my earlier piece on using Colab and GPUs.\n\nCheck out the full walkthrough here:\n[insert blog URL]\n\nAny questions about running LLMs locally on Mac?\n\nStep 7: Style, Voice, and Flow Audit\n- One em dash used for clarity.\n- No repeated first lines or phrases.\n- Scannable, clear, direct. Honest tone.\n- Only refers to Shaw’s actual post and previously established statements.\n- Only one CTA/question at the end.\n- White space used.\n\nStep 8: Final Post",

Here’s how to do it locally.\n\nToo many tutorials assume you’ve got access to Nvidia GPUs.\nBut if you’re a Mac user—especially with an M-series chip—most mainstream guides just don’t apply.\n\nIn my latest article, I break down a simple, step-by-step way to fine-tune large language models using only your local Mac hardware. No Colab. No cloud GPUs. Just your Mac and an afternoon.\n\nThis post is part of my practical LLM series and builds on my earlier Colab-based example.\n\nRead the walkthrough here:\n[insert blog URL]\n\nAny questions about running LLMs locally on Mac?"
