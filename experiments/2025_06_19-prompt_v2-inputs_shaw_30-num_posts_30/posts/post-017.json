These tools will carry you farther than chasing shiny trends.\"\n- [Trend/urgency]: \"AI is moving fast, but my stack remains simple for a reason.\"\n\nStep 5B: Notes\n- User's own phrasing is clean, but may need a more energetic hook for engagement.\n- Problem/solution: Many beginners are paralyzed by choice.\n- Personal opinion: Relatable and positions Shaw as a peer.\n- Beginner clarity: Could reassure newbies.\n- Trend/urgency: Keeps it grounded and honest, avoids hype.\n\nStep 5C: Chosen hook direction\nGo for a mix of clarity + personal: \"If I could only pick 8 tools for my AI work in 2025, here’s what I’d grab.\"\n\nStep 6: Draft full post\nIf I could only pick 8 tools for my AI work in 2025, here’s what I’d grab:\n\n- Python: Still the foundation for most AI projects—simple, powerful, and reliable.\n- Jupyter Lab: My go-to for rapid prototyping and experimentation.\n- Cursor: The AI-powered IDE that's sped up my workflows this year.\n- ChatGPT: For brainstorming, troubleshooting, and generating ideas when I hit a wall.\n- OpenAI API: The backbone for building and testing LLM-powered apps.\n- Hugging Face: For models, datasets, and the thriving ecosystem.\n- Sentence Transformers: My default for semantic search and working with embeddings.\n- GitHub: Still the essential place for code and collaboration.\n\nThis stack covers 90% of what I build day-to-day—no shiny objects or hype, just what actually gets work done.\n\nWhat’s missing from your stack?\n\nStep 7: Style and flow review\n- No repeated words in first lines.\n- One em dash used, links ideas smoothly.\n- White space and bullets for scan-ability.\n- Tone: humble, clear, peer-level, action-focused.\n- CTA is focused: one question, no “or/and.”\n\nStep 8: Final post below.",
