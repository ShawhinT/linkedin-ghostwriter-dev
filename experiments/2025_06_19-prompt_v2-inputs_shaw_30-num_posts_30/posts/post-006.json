  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Share key lessons from a journey to 70k (income, audience, subscribers?)—likely to educate, inspire, and validate Shaw’s expertise and credibility.\n- Audience: Fellow entrepreneurs, indie hackers, aspiring creators/solopreneurs, and those interested in building online businesses.\n\nStep 2: Post Wireframe\n- Hook: 0 to 70k is a big leap—frame it as possible for others; call out a pain point or commonly held belief/offers tangible takeaways.\n- Body: Short story/recap of the journey; 3-5 bullet-point lessons learned (focus on the “how” and mental models rather than just tactics); keep each point punchy and actionable.\n- CTA: Invite readers to share their own lesson, or ask what stage they're at on their journey.\n\nStep 3: Body\nAfter hitting 70k (whether that’s revenue, audience, etc.), briefly share what that process looked like (high-level, no fabricated details; e.g., starting out with no experience/audience, iterating, key pivots). List 3-5 lessons/principles with real, simple language:\n- Lesson 1: Consistency beats everything\n- Lesson 2: Focus on solving real problems, not vanity metrics\n- Lesson 3: Learning in public accelerates everything\n- Lesson 4: Don’t over-optimize\n- Lesson 5: Ship early, then iterate\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhat’s the biggest lesson you’ve learned on your own journey?\n\nStep 5A: Hook Directions\n- [Problem/Solution] “Most people overcomplicate their first $70k online — here’s what really mattered.”\n- [Results/Milestone] “How I went from 0 to $70k: the 5 lessons I wish I knew earlier.”\n- [Personal story] “What 0 to 70k taught me (not what I expected).”\n- [Beginner-to-expert] “Before I started, $70k seemed impossible. Here’s the truth.”\n- [User’s own phrasing] “My Journey from 0 to 70k (key lessons)”\n\nStep 5B: Short Notes\n- [Problem/Solution] Overcomplicating with tools, growth hacks—main factor is consistent output and real value.\n- [Results/Milestone] Frame around actions, not luck or “secret.”\n- [Personal story] Assumptions starting out versus what actually mattered.\n- [Beginner-to-expert] Call out old self; $70k seems unattainable—break it down.\n- [User's own phrasing] Direct and clear, signals transparency.\n\nStep 5C: Choose strongest hook direction\nGo with a direct milestone/results-driven hook: “How I went from 0 to $70k: the 5 lessons I wish I knew earlier.”\n\nStep 6: Draft Post\nHow I went from 0 to $70k: the 5 lessons I wish I knew earlier.\n\nLooking back, it wasn’t hustle, flashy hacks, or luck.\n\nHere’s what actually made the difference for me:\n\n1. Consistency wins. Showing up every week (even when it’s crickets) compounds over time.\n2. Focus on real problems. Tools and trends come and go–solve something that actually matters to people.\n3. Learn in public. Sharing what you’re learning attracts mentors, peers, and new opportunities.\n4. Don’t over-optimize. You don’t need the “perfect” system—just start, then improve.\n5. Ship early, iterate often. The sooner you launch, the faster you’ll learn and grow.\n\nBuilding to this point was full of mistakes and pivots, but these are the principles I still follow (and wish I’d embraced from day one).\n\nWhat’s the biggest lesson you’ve learned on your own journey?\n\nStep 7: Review for Style, Voice, and Flow\n- One em dash; justified to clarify a key message.\n- No repeated phrases, clear scannable structure.\n- Tone matches: honest, direct, approachable; bullet points for clarity.\n- Only references personal lessons; no fabricated details or results.\n- Single, clear CTA at end.\n\nStep 8: Final Post",
