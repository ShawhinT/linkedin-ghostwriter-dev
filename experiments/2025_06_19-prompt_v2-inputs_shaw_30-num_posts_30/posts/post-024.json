  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Share content (video) and educate the LinkedIn audience on applying multimodal LLMs to computer vision tasks using Llama 3.2 Vision.\n- Audience: AI engineers, technical learners, and anyone interested in LLMs and computer vision applications.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n[Hook]\n[Main body: context on multimodal LLMs; what’s interesting about Llama 3.2 Vision for CV; intro to the video; why it matters]\n[Link to video]\n[CTA: One clear question or action]\n\nStep 3: Meat\n- Multimodal LLMs are now practical for vision tasks\n- Llama 3.2 Vision makes it easy to experiment and learn\n- Video walkthrough, demo, or explanation (provide link)\n- Why Llama 3.2 Vision is notable or useful (e.g., lowering the barrier for CV workflows)\n\nStep 4: CTA\n- What CV use case would you want to try with an LLM?\n\nStep 5: Hook Directions\nA. [Problem/solution] Most people think LLMs are just for text. Here’s how they tackle images.\nB. [Trend/urgency] Multimodal is the future—see it in action.\nC. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] You don’t need to be a deep learning PhD to use vision models now.\nD. [User’s own phrasing] Multimodal LLMs in practice: Using Llama 3.2 Vision for computer vision.\nE. [Results/outcomes] Walkthrough: Llama 3.2 Vision does X with your images.\n\nStep 5 Notes\nA. Tease practical demo, break stereotype\nB. Highlight rapid change—get ahead\nC. Lower barrier, show accessibility\nD. Clear statement of what’s being shared\nE. Show, don’t just tell\n\nStep 5C: Choose B (“Multimodal is the future—see it in action”). The urgency and trend fit well for this audience and content type.\n\nStep 6: Draft Full Post\nMultimodal is the future—see it in action.\n\nIf you still think LLMs are just for text, you’re missing out on the next wave of practical AI.\n\nI just released a video showing how you can use Llama 3.2 Vision for computer vision tasks.\n\nYou no longer need a PhD in deep learning or a cluster of GPUs to experiment with images. Llama 3.2 Vision makes it possible to:\n- Analyze images with natural language prompts\n- Build simple CV workflows directly in Python\n- Prototype real AI-powered apps with just a few lines of code\n\nHere’s the video: [insert link]\n\nWhat computer vision use case would *you* want to try with a multimodal LLM?\n\nStep 7: Review for Style, Voice, Flow\n- Voice is direct, actionable, and focused on practical outcomes. One em dash in hook (intentional, adds emphasis). Bullet points for scannability. No assumptions about personal experience—informative and inviting only.\n\nStep 8: Final Post Below.",
