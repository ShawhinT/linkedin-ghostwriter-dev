  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Educate others by sharing key AI principles and lessons learned over the years (reflective wisdom).\n- Audience: Early career AI engineers, technical learners, young entrepreneurs interested in AI, anyone starting or feeling overwhelmed by AI/ML advice.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n- Hook: A punchy one-liner about wisdom learned \"too late\" (invites relatable regret).\n- Body: 5 concrete principles (listed)\n- CTA: Ask readers which principle they wish they learned sooner\n\nStep 3: Body (“meat”)\n\nLooking back, these 5 stand out:\n\n1) Don’t default to using AI — many problems are better solved with simpler tools.\n2) Focus on the problem, not the tech — obsess over what needs solving, not what’s trending.\n3) Spend more time curating your data — most real progress comes from fixing messy/unclear data, not chasing fancy models.\n4) Data quality > quantity — 100 good examples beats 10,000 mediocre ones.\n5) Always run experiments — nothing beats actually testing what works with your data and use case.\n\nStep 4: CTA or question\n\nWhat’s one principle YOU wish you’d learned sooner in your AI journey?\n\nStep 5: Hook directions (brainstorm)\n- [User’s own phrasing]: “AI principles I know at 29, I wish I had known at 24.”\n- [Problem/solution]: “Most people waste years in AI by obsessing over the wrong things.”\n- [Trend/urgency]: “Everyone’s talking about AI breakthroughs, but these 5 basics matter way more.”\n- [Beginner-to-expert clarity]: “You don’t need more AI tools—just these timeless principles.”\n- [Personal story]: “If I could talk to my 24-year-old self about AI, I’d share these 5 lessons.”\n\nStep 5B: Add notes\n- [User’s phrase] is clear and confessional — instantly frames this as learned experience.\n- [Problem/solution] less personal, more categorical — but less punchy.\n- [Trend/urgency] a bit hype-y for Shaw’s voice.\n- [Beginner-to-expert] could work: focus on timelessness.\n- [Personal story] close to user’s statement.\n\nStep 5C: Pick best angle\n- User’s phrasing is strong and personal. Plus, it’s humble.\n\nStep 6: Write draft of full post\n\nAI principles I know at 29, I wish I had known at 24.\n\nIf I could send advice back to my younger self, these would be at the top:\n\n1) Don’t automatically reach for AI — sometimes a spreadsheet (or a for loop) solves it better.\n2) Focus on problems, not tech — the tech is only useful if it actually solves your need.\n3) Prioritize data curation — fixing and understanding your data beats fiddling with model settings.\n4) Data quality > data quantity — more isn’t better unless your “more” is good.\n5) Run experiments — you don’t know until you try, so test before you argue.\n\nWhat’s one principle you wish you’d learned sooner about AI (or tech in general)?\n\nStep 7: Review for style, voice, flow\n- Tone: Humble, reflective, peer-to-peer\n- Clear, short sentences\n- No em dash abuse\n- List is scannable, simple language\n- Ends with only one question\n\nStep 8: Write final post",
  "final_post": "AI principles I know at 29, I wish I had known at 24.\n\nLooking back, these 5 stand out:\n\n1) Don’t use AI by default — sometimes a simple script or spreadsheet wins.\n2) Focus on problems, not tech — solving real needs is what matters.\n3) Spend more time on data curation — messy data is almost always the real bottleneck.\n4) Data quality > data quantity — a handful of great examples beats a mountain of mediocre ones.\n5) Always run experiments — you don’t actually know until you test.\n\nWhat’s one principle you wish you’d learned sooner in your AI journey?"
