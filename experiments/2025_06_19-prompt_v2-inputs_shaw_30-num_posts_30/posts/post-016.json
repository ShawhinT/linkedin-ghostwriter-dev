  "writing_steps": "Step 1:\n- Purpose: Share and promote an educational resource (blog) on fine-tuning BERT for text classification. \n- Target audience: AI/ML practitioners, aspiring data scientists, and engineers interested in NLP, possibly Shaw's followers seeking hands-on guides.\n\nStep 2:\nWireframe:\n\n[Hook: Line that signals practical info/solution above the fold]\n\n[Meat: 1-3 lines on what the blog covers/why it's useful; emphasizes practical focus or beginner-friendliness]\n\n[Link to blog]\n\n[CTA: Single question inviting readers to share challenges/tips or to drop questions]\n\nStep 3:\nThe body/meat:\n\nFine-tuning large language models like BERT can feel intimidating, but it doesn’t have to be.\n\nI recently published a step-by-step blog post breaking down how to fine-tune BERT for text classification. It covers:\n- Prepping your dataset\n- Adapting BERT for your labels\n- Training & evaluation\n- Common pitfalls and fixes\n\nWhether you’re new to NLP or trying to get your first custom model working, this guide keeps things practical and actionable.\n\nStep 4:\nCTA: What’s been the hardest part of fine-tuning transformer models for you?\n\nStep 5:\nHook directions:\n- [Problem/solution] \"Fine-tuning BERT for text classification doesn't have to feel overwhelming.\"\n- [Beginner-to-Expert Clarity] \"If BERT fine-tuning feels like a black box—this guide is for you.\"\n- [Results/Outcomes] \"Get your own custom text classifier running with BERT—step-by-step.\"\n- [User’s own phrasing] \"Fine-tuning BERT for text classification: new blog post.\"\n- [Action/Practicality] \"Want to fine-tune BERT for your data? Here’s a hands-on walkthrough.\"\n\nMost promising: [Beginner-to-Expert Clarity] or [Problem/solution], since many find fine-tuning intimidating/confusing.\n\nStrongest hook:\n\"Fine-tuning BERT for text classification doesn’t have to be a black box.\"\n\nStep 6:\nDraft of full post:\n\nFine-tuning BERT for text classification doesn’t have to be a black box.\n\nI just published a blog post walking through the full process step-by-step:\n- Prepping your data\n- Setting up BERT for your task\n- Training & evaluation\n- Troubleshooting common pitfalls\n\nWhether you’re new to NLP or looking for a practical template, you’ll find concrete examples and tips you can use right away.\n\nRead the full guide here: [link]\n\nWhat’s been the trickiest part of fine-tuning transformer models for you?\n\nStep 7:\n- One em dash in the hook, justified for clarity.\n- Clear, scannable, practical.\n- Avoids assumptions about Shaw’s personal experience. Shares a resource and invites interaction.\n- Flows well, ends with a strong single CTA.\n\nStep 8:\nFinal post below.",
