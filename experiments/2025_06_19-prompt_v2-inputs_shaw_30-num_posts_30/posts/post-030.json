  "writing_steps": "Step 1:\n- Purpose: Share Shaw's latest blog post on multimodal embeddings and spark discussion around the topic. Educate and invite feedback from technical peers and learners.\n- Target audience: AI practitioners, data scientists, students, and entrepreneurs interested in AI/ML, especially those curious about how multimodal embeddings work or can be applied.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n[Hook about how multimodal embeddings are changing or unlocking new AI capabilities]\n[Brief summary or teaser of what the blog covers, in plain language; why it's interesting/important]\n[Link to the blog]\n[Question: What's your experience/opinion/pain point about building with multimodal embeddings?]\n\nStep 3: Body (the \"meat\")\nMultimodal embeddings are becoming a core component of next-generation AI systems. By integrating information from images, text, audio (and more), they allow models to reason across diverse types of data—opening up new possibilities for applications and user experiences. \n\nIf you're interested in a technical breakdown as well as practical tips for getting started, I've shared my approach and lessons in this new blog post. \n\nStep 4: CTA/Question\nWhat’s the biggest challenge you’ve faced when working with multimodal embeddings?\n\nStep 5A: Hook Brainstorming Directions\n- [Trend/urgency] Multimodal AI is rapidly becoming mainstream—the stakes are high for keeping up\n- [Problem/solution] Many struggle to combine text and image data effectively—multimodal embeddings bridge the gap\n- [Beginner clarity] “What ARE multimodal embeddings, and why do they matter?”\n- [Results] \"Unlocking new capabilities in AI with multimodal embeddings\"\n- [User’s own phrasing] Share blog: multimodal embeddings (not enough punch, but keep in mind)\n\nStep 5B: Add notes to each direction\n- [Trend/urgency] “If you aren’t thinking multimodal, you’re already behind”\n- [Problem/solution] “Ever wanted to search images using text—or vice versa? Multimodal embeddings make this possible”\n- [Beginner clarity] “Most AI models only work with one type of data. What happens when you mix images, text, or even audio?”\n- [Results] “Why multimodal embeddings are the most underrated power tool in modern AI”\n- [User] Not compelling enough\n\nStep 5C: Choose strongest direction and write hook\nLet’s go with the beginner clarity + mild urgency:\n\n\"Why is everyone talking about multimodal embeddings? (And should you care?)\"\n\nStep 6: Full draft\n\nWhy is everyone talking about multimodal embeddings? (And should you care?)\n\nMultimodal embeddings are quickly becoming a core building block of next-gen AI systems. By combining information from text, images, or other data sources, we can finally build models that understand the world more like we do.\n\nI've shared a new blog post breaking down the basics, practical tips for getting started, and a peek at how I approach these systems in my own projects.\n\nRead it here: [Link to blog]\n\nWhat’s the biggest challenge you’ve faced when working with multimodal embeddings?\n\nStep 7: Review for style, voice, and flow\n- Removed excess em dashes\n- Clear, direct, slightly conversational\n- Brief, actionable, and ends with a single question\n- No assumptions about Shaw’s direct experience; invites peer discussion\n- Good scannability/formatting\n\nStep 8: Final post",
