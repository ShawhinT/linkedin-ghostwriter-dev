  "input": "Share blog: fine-tuning FLUX.1 on my face!\n\nContext:\nAlthough large language models (LLMs) seem to get all the attention these days, image-generation models have been advancing just as rapidly. The current state-of-the-art is FLUX.1, an image model from Black Forest Labs (a faction from the Stable Diffusion team). In this article, I share the full process I used for fine-tuning this model to generate unlimited high-quality photos of myself.",
  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Share Shaw's new blog post about fine-tuning the FLUX.1 image model on his own face, and educate readers about state-of-the-art image-generation models.\n- Audience: Technical creators, AI enthusiasts, and anyone curious about generative AI (including LLM/AI users who might not have explored image models much).\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n- Hook: LLMs get all the buzz, but image models are moving just as fast...\n- Meat: Quick intro to FLUX.1 and why it's exciting. Briefly tease the personal project: fine-tuning to create high-quality photos of myself. Mention that the article walks through the full process and what you can expect to learn.\n- CTA: \"Curious how I did it? Check out the full walkthrough.\"\n- (Link to blog before CTA)\n\nStep 3: Meat\nAlthough LLMs dominate the headlines, image-generation models have quietly reached a whole new level.\n\nOne standout: FLUX.1 from Black Forest Labs (some of the same minds behind Stable Diffusion). It's one of the most advanced image synthesis models available today.\n\nRecently, I dove in and fine-tuned FLUX.1—on my own face.\n\nThe result? Unlimited, high-fidelity images of myself, generated in any style I could imagine.\n\nI documented the entire workflow—from data prep and model choice to sample outputs—in my latest blog post.\n\nStep 4: CTA\nCurious how I did it? Check out the full walkthrough.\n\nStep 5A: Hook Directions\n- [Trend/urgency] \"LLMs get all the buzz, but image models are evolving just as quickly.\"\n- [Personal story] \"I fine-tuned a state-of-the-art model—to generate unlimited photos of myself.\"\n- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] \"Think LLMs are the only exciting thing in AI? Think again.\"\n- [Tool/tech spotlight] \"Meet FLUX.1: the new frontier in image-generation models.\"\n\nStep 5B: Notes\n- [Trend/urgency] Contrasting AI trends. \"Everyone focuses on LLMs, but image models quietly reach new heights.\"\n- [Personal story] Novelty of making endless high-quality selfies with AI.\n- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] Demystifying the cutting edge of image AI.\n- [Tool/tech] \"What sets FLUX.1 apart?\"\n\nStep 5C: Final Hook\nLLMs get all the attention, but image-generation models are quietly catching up—and doing some wild things.\n\nStep 6: Draft Post\nLLMs get all the attention, but image-generation models are quietly catching up—and doing some wild things.\n\nCase in point: FLUX.1 from Black Forest Labs (yes, the folks behind Stable Diffusion).\n\nThis week, I decided to fine-tune FLUX.1—on my own face.\n\nWhy? To see if I could generate unlimited, high-quality photos of myself in any style I could imagine (just for fun, and a bit of science).\n\nI walked through the full process in my latest blog post:\n\n- How the workflow works\n- What makes FLUX.1 unique\n- What I learned (with plenty of examples)\n\nRead the full breakdown here: [LINK]\n\nCurious how I did it? Check out the walkthrough.\n\nStep 7: Style & Voice Review\n- Direct, clear, and technical but approachable tone\n- No assumption of results or detail beyond what is provided\n- No more than one em dash\n- Teases why FLUX.1 matters, but doesn't invent details\n- Good white space and scannability\n- Only one CTA\n\nStep 8: Final Post",
