  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose and Audience\n- Purpose: Educate and inspire solopreneurs and early founders by sharing hard-earned lessons from a conversation with a successful $100k/mo entrepreneur.\n- Audience: Solopreneurs, founders, consultants, and anyone running (or aspiring to run) an online business or freelance service, especially those focused on AI/tech.\n\nStep 2: Post Wireframe\n[Hook: Powerful, curiosity-driven opener teasing the investment and outcome.]\n\n[Body: 5-point breakdown of key lessons, each with a brief annotation or expansion.]\n\n[CTA: One focused question to spark reflection/discussion.]\n\nStep 3: Write the body (meat)\n\nLate last year, I paid a $100k/mo entrepreneur for a 1:1 call to accelerate my business growth. Here’s what shifted for me:\n\n1. **Customer pain points matter more than your skillset**: People don’t care about your resume—only how you solve their problem.\n2. **Charge for value, not time**: Selling hours keeps your income capped. Price based on outcomes instead.\n3. **Higher price tag = longer copy**: If you’re asking for more money, delay the ask. Let people self-qualify and build trust before you sell.\n4. **Get ultra-specific on your “avatar”**: Know who you serve, then create content that attracts only those people.\n5. **The jump from $10k to $100k/mo isn’t about tech skills—it’s about strategy**: It’s how you package, position, and sell, not the tech under the hood.\n\nStep 4: Write the CTA\nWhat’s the #1 business strategy lesson you wish you learned sooner?\n\nStep 5A: Brainstorm hook directions\n- [User’s phrasing] \"I paid a $100k/mo entrepreneur to talk to me... here’s what I learned.\"\n- [Curiosity/Payoff] \"Would you pay $$$ to shortcut five years of trial and error? I did, and here’s what I’d tell myself.\"\n- [Contrarian/Challenge] \"Skills don’t get you past $10k/month—the right strategies do. Here’s how I learned that from a $100k/mo entrepreneur.\"\n- [Numbers] “5 lessons from a $100k/mo founder—none about code.”\n- [Direct Problem/Solution] “Why most tech founders burn out before $10k/mo (and what $100k/mo sellers know).”\n\nStep 5B: Label + key phrases for each direction\n- [User’s phrasing] Honest, curiosity-driven; feels authentic to Shaw\n- [Curiosity/Payoff] Emphasizes paying to shortcut mistakes\n- [Contrarian/Challenge] Appeals to those stuck at a revenue plateau, calls out common trap\n- [Numbers] “5 lessons…”—clean, list-driven\n- [Direct Problem/Solution] Appeals to frustration for tech-heavy founders\n\nStep 5C: Choose the strongest hook direction and write final hook\nI’m going with [User’s phrasing] as it’s candid, curiosity-driven, and likely to grab attention authentically.\n\nFinal hook: I paid a $100k/month entrepreneur for their advice. Here are the 5 lessons that changed how I build my business.\n\nStep 6: Draft Full Post\n\nI paid a $100k/month entrepreneur for their advice. Here are the 5 lessons that changed how I build my business:\n\n1. Customer pain points matter more than your skills—people pay to solve a problem, not for your resume.\n2. Price based on value, not your hours—the bigger the outcome, the bigger your potential revenue.\n3. Higher price = longer copy. The more you charge, the longer you need to nurture and educate your audience before the ask.\n4. Get hyper-specific on your avatar—know *exactly* who you’re serving, and create free content to attract just them.\n5. The difference between $10k and $100k/month is strategy, not skills. The right packaging and positioning matter more than your tech stack.\n\nWhat’s one business lesson you wish you’d learned sooner?\n\nStep 7: Style, Voice, and Flow Review\n- No em dashes abuse (one used, justified for summary punchiness)\n- Clear, direct, concise points\n- Bulleted/scannable format\n- No assumption of Shaw’s unique experience except what's given\n- Ends with a single focused CTA question\n- Tone is approachable-expert, candid, and actionable\n\nStep 8: Final Post",
