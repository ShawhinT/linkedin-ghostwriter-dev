  "input": "Share blog: compressing LLMs.\n\nSnippet: While the immense scale of LLMs is responsible for their impressive performance across a wide range of use cases, this presents challenges in their application to real-world problems. In this article, I discuss how we can overcome these challenges by compressing LLMs. I start with a high-level overview of key concepts and then walk through a concrete example with Python code.",
  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose and Audience\n- Purpose: Share Shaw's new blog post to help fellow practitioners or learners understand the topic and promote the blog.\n- Audience: AI engineers, technical learners, and anyone interested in practical applications and optimizations for LLMs.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n- Hook: Highlights the scale/performance trade-off and the potential for overcoming it.\n- Meat: Briefly explain why compressing LLMs matters, high-level concepts, and mention code example. Promote the blog link.\n- CTA: Ask a single question to spark discussion (e.g., most pressing problem with deploying LLMs?)\n\nStep 3: Body\nThe size of large language models (LLMs) is both a strength and a hurdle. While they excel at a huge range of tasks, deploying them in real applications comes with real engineering trade-offs—from infrastructure costs to latency and accessibility.\n\nIn my latest post, I break down what LLM compression is (in simple terms), why it matters, and what techniques you can try today. If you're a practitioner who likes concrete takeaways, I also included a Python walkthrough so you can see these ideas in action.\n\nRead the full post here: [BLOG LINK]\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhat’s your biggest pain point when deploying LLMs in real applications?\n\nStep 5: Hook Brainstorm\nA.\t[Problem/solution] “LLMs are too big to deploy—here’s how we shrink them (with actual code)”\nB.\t[Beginner-to-expert clarity] “Think LLMs are too bulky for your project? There’s a way forward.”\nC.\t[Trend/urgency] “Model compression is about to become a requirement, not just a ‘nice-to-have’”\nD.\t[User’s own phrasing/summary] “The immense scale of LLMs drives their power—and their problems. Here’s how to fix it.”\nE.\t[Actionable angle] “How to make LLMs actually usable in real-world settings (with Python code)”\n\nNotes:\nA. Focuses on practical challenge and solution\nB. Calls out a misconception and invites non-experts\nC. Foresight/trend angle\nD. Uses the blog’s own words\nE. Actionable, technical appeal.\n\nStep 6: Choose best direction & Write Hook\nI’ll go with A, as it’s direct, technical, and tees up the concrete example in the blog.\n\n“LLMs are too big to deploy? Here’s how we shrink them—with actual code.”\n\nStep 7: Draft of Full Post\nLLMs are too big to deploy? Here’s how we shrink them—with actual code.\n\nThe size of large language models is both their superpower and their Achilles’ heel. While they unlock state-of-the-art performance across a ton of use cases, actually running them in production is a different story—cost, speed, and resource needs quickly become real blockers.\n\nTo tackle this, I put together a new blog post: it covers the high-level ideas behind compressing LLMs, walks through why it matters, and even includes a practical Python example.\n\nIf you’re working with LLMs and want them to fit into real projects (not just research slides), this one’s for you.\n\nRead the blog: [BLOG LINK]\n\nWhat’s your biggest pain point when deploying LLMs in real applications?\n\nStep 8: Review for style, voice, and flow\n- Only one em dash appears—and justified for contrast/voice.\n- No repeated phrasing in hook vs body.\n- Promotes the blog directly; doesn’t claim personal results.\n- Ends with a clear, focused CTA.\n- Bullet points not needed for this brief/announcement-style post.\n- Feels actionable, grounded, and in Shaw's voice.\n\nFinalize post.",
