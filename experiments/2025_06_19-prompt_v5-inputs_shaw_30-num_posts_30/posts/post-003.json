  "writing_steps": "Step 1: \nPurpose: Educate and demystify the habits of top AI engineers, encouraging more hands-on technical project building. \nTarget Audience: Aspiring AI engineers, early-career technical professionals, solo founders curious about skill-building in AI.\n\nStep 2:\nPost wireframe:\n[Short, direct hook calling out a misconception]\n[Body: Call out the belief that 'top' means 'smarter', explain that building more projects is what separates practitioners, show stepwise breakdown or practical advice]\n[CTA: Invite readers to share practical project ideas or experiences]\n\nStep 3:\nBody:\n- Many assume top AI engineers succeed because they’re much smarter.\n- In reality, the key difference is often the volume and consistency of building projects.\n- The more you actually build:\n  • The more problems you solve firsthand\n  • The more systems you break (and debug)\n  • The more you develop technical confidence\n- You don’t need to invent new algorithms. Start with basic AI projects, automate small workflows, or clone a simple open-source tool. \n\nStep 4:\nCTA: What’s the last AI project you built?\n\nStep 5:\nStep 5A: Brainstorm hook angles:\n1. [User's phrasing] Most top AI engineers aren’t more intelligent than you. They just do this one thing more… BUILD\n2. [Misconception bust] Being 'top' in AI is less about intelligence—more about time spent building.\n3. [Numbers/clarity] 3 reasons hands-on projects separate the best AI engineers\n4. [Beginner/expert myth] You don’t have to be a genius to excel at AI engineering\n5. [Actionable] If you want to get better at AI, start more projects (here’s why)\n\nStep 5B: Add notes\n1. User’s phrasing—direct, bold, calls out a perceived difference\n2. Addresses common misconception; factual\n3. Numerated, actionable content\n4. Encourages without motivation, corrects common myth\n5. Sets up for practical advice\n\nStep 5C: Choose the best\nUser’s phrasing is strong, but I’d remove the ellipsis/“one thing more” to maintain clear, direct style. Favor a blend of the first and second options.\nFinal Hook: Most top AI engineers aren’t more intelligent than you. They just build more projects.\n\nStep 6:\nDraft:\nMost top AI engineers aren’t more intelligent than you. They just build more projects.\n\nA lot of people assume success in AI is about coming up with novel algorithms or being a math genius. I’ve seen that the main difference is the amount of time spent building real things.\n\nThe more projects you finish, the faster you:\n- Encounter real technical problems (and solve them)\n- Gain experience breaking and debugging code\n- Build the confidence to tackle harder problems\n\nYou don’t need to invent something new. Start with a basic idea, automate a workflow, or copy a public tool for practice.\n\nWhat’s the last AI project you built?\n\nStep 7:\n- Only one em dash (none currently used)\n- No motivational or reflection prompts\n- No business clichés or idioms\n- Single CTA\n- Factual, action-oriented, educational\n- Matches the persona in examples 1 and 4\n\nStep 8:\nReady for final post.",
  "final_post": "Most top AI engineers aren’t more intelligent than you. They just build more projects.\n\nA lot of people assume success in AI is about inventing new algorithms or being a math genius. In reality, what sets many engineers apart is how often they’re shipping real projects.\n\nThe more you build, the more you:\n- Run into real technical problems (and learn to solve them)\n- Break and fix systems yourself\n- Build confidence for the next project\n\nYou don’t need to create something original every time. Start with a simple tool, automate a basic workflow, or rebuild something open-source for practice.\n\nWhat’s the last AI project you built?"
