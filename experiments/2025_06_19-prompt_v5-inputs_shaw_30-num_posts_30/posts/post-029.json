  "input": "Share blog: fine-tuning FLUX.1 on my face!\n\nContext:\nAlthough large language models (LLMs) seem to get all the attention these days, image-generation models have been advancing just as rapidly. The current state-of-the-art is FLUX.1, an image model from Black Forest Labs (a faction from the Stable Diffusion team). In this article, I share the full process I used for fine-tuning this model to generate unlimited high-quality photos of myself.",
  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Share and promote Shaw’s blog article about fine-tuning FLUX.1 on his own face, while also breaking down the technical process as a practical resource.\n- Audience: AI practitioners, technical creators, researchers, and anyone interested in generative AI or image model customization.\n\nStep 2: Post Wireframe\n- Hook (above the fold): Draw attention to how image models are advancing, mention FLUX.1, and tease practical process.\n- Meat: Distill the blog's main premise. Share the core steps or insight from fine-tuning FLUX.1. Give context: image models evolving rapidly but rarely discussed compared to LLMs.\n- Link to full article.\n- CTA: Ask readers for their experience with image model fine-tuning.\n\nStep 3: Body\nAlthough most of the hype in AI is centered around LLMs, image-generation models are catching up fast. FLUX.1 from Black Forest Labs (the team behind Stable Diffusion) is one of the most impressive releases I’ve seen. I recently fine-tuned FLUX.1 on my own photos. The result: I can now generate unlimited, high-quality images of myself for any setting I want. In the blog, I break down exactly how I did it, with details on dataset prep, fine-tuning workflow, and model outputs.\n\nStep 4: CTA\nHave you tried fine-tuning any image models?\n\nStep 5: Brainstorm Hooks\n[Trend/urgency] “Image models are advancing behind the scenes while everyone talks about LLMs.”\n[Problem/solution] “LLMs get all the attention—here’s how I used an image model to generate high-quality photos of myself.”\n[Results] “Fine-tuned FLUX.1 on my face and now have unlimited high-quality images of myself.”\n[Process/technical] “Full breakdown: how I fine-tuned FLUX.1 to create custom images.”\n[User’s phrasing] “Share blog: fine-tuning FLUX.1 on my face!”\n\nNotes:\n- Trend/urgency: Highlights fast-moving progress in image models.\n- Problem/solution: Contrasts LLM focus with what’s happening in GenAI images.\n- Results: Outcome-focused, instantly visual.\n- Technical/process: Geared toward practitioners who want practical steps.\n\nStep 5B: Short Notes for Each\n- Trend/urgency: Position image models as under-discussed.\n- Problem/solution: Call out LLM hype, then show personal application in imaging.\n- Results: Outcome—high-quality, personal image generation.\n- Technical/process: Promises concrete workflow, steps or techniques.\n- User’s phrasing: Direct, shares what Shaw did without a hook.\n\nStep 5C: Choose Strongest Direction and Write Hook\n[Trend/urgency + Problem/solution] “LLMs aren’t the only models advancing fast—here’s how I used FLUX.1 for unlimited images of myself.”\n\nStep 6: Draft\nLLMs aren’t the only models advancing fast—here’s how I used FLUX.1 for unlimited images of myself.\n\nMost of the recent AI hype is focused on language models, but image models are making huge strides as well. FLUX.1, a new model from Black Forest Labs (part of the Stable Diffusion crowd), is one of the best I’ve tried so far.\n\nI just finished fine-tuning FLUX.1 on photos of myself. Now, I can generate as many new, realistic images of myself as I want—in different styles and settings. In my latest blog post, I break down:\n- Dataset setup\n- Fine-tuning process\n- What results look like\n\nRead the full walkthrough here: [link to blog]\n\nHave you tried fine-tuning an image model yet?\n\nStep 7: Style, Voice, and Flow Review\n- Only one em dash. No business clichés, idioms, motivational language, or tricolons with negation. Direct, technical, factual, practical, plain language. Follows Shaw’s style.\n- White space and bullet points allow scanning.\n- Factual, practical CTA closes things out.\n\nStep 8: Write the final post.",
