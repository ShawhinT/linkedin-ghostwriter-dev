  "input": "Share blog: Local LLM fine-tuning on Mac\n\nContext:\nThis article is part of a larger series on using large language models (LLMs) in practice. In a previous post, I showed how to fine-tune an LLM using a single (free) GPU on Google Colab. While that example (and many others) readily runs on Nvidia hardware, they are not easily adapted to M-series Macs. In this article, I walk through an easy way to fine-tune an LLM locally on a Mac.",
  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose/audience\n- Purpose: Share a new practical blog post and resource. Educate on how to fine-tune LLMs locally on a Mac using M-series chips. Contextualize this in a broader series. Invite technical readers to try and give feedback.\n- Audience: Developers, AI practitioners, ML learners, Mac users who follow Shaw's content series or need solutions for running/fine-tuning LLMs with Mac hardware.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n- Hook: Point to the common Nvidia bias in LLM guides and tease the solution for Mac users.\n- Meat: Context of the series, why this topic matters, describe what readers will get (a practical walkthrough for Mac). Basic contrast to previous Colab/Nvidia tutorial. Link to blog.\n- CTA: Invite Mac/LLM users to share their challenges or additions to the process.\n\nStep 3: Body\nA lot of LLM tutorials assume you have Nvidia hardware, but this isn’t reality for many of us running on Macs. In my latest post, I cover a simple process for fine-tuning LLMs locally on an M-series Mac. This builds on my earlier Colab GPU tutorial, but adapts each step for macOS and Apple silicon. The guide walks through setup, tuning, and potential troubleshooting using tools that run natively.\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhat are your biggest challenges with local LLM workflows on Mac?\n\nStep 5: Hook — Brainstorm directions\n- [Problem/solution] Most LLM tutorials only work for Nvidia—here’s a Mac-native option\n- [Trend/urgency] More devs are using Macs, but the LLM tooling isn’t keeping up\n- [User’s own phrasing] “Local LLM fine-tuning on Mac: a simple walkthrough”\n- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] If you’re lost trying to adapt Colab or Nvidia guides to Mac, this is for you\n\nStep 5A: Add notes to each direction\n- [Problem/solution] A lot of the community is left out by current Nvidia-only guides—solutions for Mac users are needed.\n- [Trend/urgency] Apple silicon becomes common for devs, but LLM tools lag.\n- [User’s own] A clear, literal description.\n- [Beginner/expert clarity] Mac users run into config errors, tool issues; this post guides step-by-step.\n\nStep 5B: Choose strongest: Problem/solution angle is the most relatable and specific here.\n\nStep 5C: Hook\n- Most LLM tutorials only work on Nvidia GPUs. Here’s how to fine-tune locally on your Mac.\n\nStep 6: Draft Post\nMost LLM tutorials only work on Nvidia GPUs. Here’s how to fine-tune locally on your Mac.\n\nA lot of resources for LLM fine-tuning assume you have access to an Nvidia card or Colab GPU, but not everyone does.\n\nIn this latest post, I show a step-by-step process for fine-tuning LLMs locally on M-series Macs. This builds on my earlier tutorial for Google Colab, but adapts the workflow to work with Apple silicon and macOS.\n\nIf you’re on an M1 or M2 Mac and want to run fine-tuning workflows without a remote server, this guide covers setup, tuning, and troubleshooting using Mac-native tools.\n\nRead the full walkthrough here: [link]\n\nWhat are your biggest challenges with local LLM workflows on Mac?\n\nStep 7: Review\n- Voice is factual, practical, no motivational hype. Language is literal.\n- Bullet points and white space used for clarity.\n- No em dash used. Clichés and idioms absent. One clear CTA.\n- Cross-checked style and tone vs. Example 1/Example 4.\n\nStep 8: Finalize",
