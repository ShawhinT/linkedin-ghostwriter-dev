  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose and Audience\n- Purpose: Educate on the value of ongoing learning as a form of wealth (intellectual capital vs. just financial capital)\n- Audience: Broad (entrepreneurs, students, tech professionals, lifelong learners)\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n[Hook: Direct challenge to the money-centric view of wealth]\n[Meat: Explain why knowledge, skills, and ongoing learning are just as valuable, if not more, than pure financial wealth — tie it to practical upskilling in fields like AI/tech]\n[CTA: Ask what field or skill people are actively learning now]\n\nStep 3: The body (meat)\nA bank account only measures one kind of wealth: money. But knowledge, skills, and mindset determine how you find new opportunities, solve problems, and adapt to change. In fast-moving fields like AI, learning isn’t just optional—it’s the only way to stay relevant. I prioritize learning new tools and frameworks even over earning more in the short-term. This habit pays off with every project I ship.\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhich skill or field are you actively learning right now?\n\nStep 5: Hook brainstorming\n1. [Problem/solution] Most people chase money but ignore skills—the real wealth is what you know.\n2. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] You can measure wealth in dollars, but that’s only a small part of the picture.\n3. [User’s phrasing] Being rich isn’t about your bank account, but your mind.\n4. [Trend/urgency] In AI, learning new skills is more valuable than earning quick cash.\n5. [Personal story] I’ve invested more effort in learning new frameworks than banking short-term gains.\n\nStep 5B: Annotate directions\n1. Call out money-focus, suggest skill-building as higher-value\n2. Expand on wealth beyond money—focus on mental capital\n3. Use the user’s own phrasing for a direct, familiar hook\n4. Make it relevant to AI and tech—show learning is the highest-yield investment\n5. Personal voice, share own approach to upskilling\n\nStep 5C: Select and write hook\nChosen: Hook 2 (Beginner-to-expert clarity)\nYou can measure wealth in dollars—but that’s only a small part of the picture.\n\nStep 6: Draft of the full post\nYou can measure wealth in dollars—but that’s only a small part of the picture.\n\nA bank account only measures one kind of wealth: money. But knowledge, skills, and mindset determine how you find new opportunities, solve problems, and adapt to change.

This habit pays off with every project I ship.\n\nWhich skill or field are you actively learning right now?\n\nStep 7: Review Post\n- Em dash count: One (justified for contrast in the first line)\n- No motivational or figurative language\n- No business clichés\n- Direct, factual, actionable\n- CTA is practical (asking about current skills/fields being learned)\n- Voice matches examples: clear, expert, honest, peer-level\n- Flow and structure: matches Shaw’s style, broken into short paragraphs; uses white space\n\nStep 8: Final post",
  "final_post": "You can measure wealth in dollars—but that’s only a small part of the picture.\n\nA bank account only captures one kind of value. Skills, knowledge, and how quickly you learn are just as important, especially with how fast technology is changing. In AI and other fast-moving fields, learning isn’t optional. It’s how you stay relevant and spot new opportunities.\n\nI invest more time learning new tools and frameworks than trying to maximize short-term income. In practice, that habit has paid off with every project I take on.\n\nWhich skill or field are you actively learning right now?"
