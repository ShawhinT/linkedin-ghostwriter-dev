  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Educate readers on the evolution of AI/software paradigms and why clarity in terminology matters \n- Audience: Broad, especially tech-interested LinkedIn users who may be confused by the term \"AI\"\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n- Hook: A factual statement about the confusion surrounding the meaning of \"AI\"\n- Meat: Briefly define Software 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0, and clearly highlight the differences\n- CTA: Ask readers for other frameworks or definitions they use\n\nStep 3: The meat/body\nAI isn’t one thing—it has evolved over decades. Here’s a basic breakdown I use:\n\n- Software 1.0: Rule-based systems (\"if this, then that\" logic; hard-coded by people)\n- Software 2.0: Machine learning (algorithms learn patterns from data and make predictions)\n- Software 3.0: Large Language Models (LLMs) (AI can generate, reason, and react to novel input using vast internet-scale data)\n\nMany conversations get mixed up because people are talking about different \"versions\" of AI without realizing it.\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhat other frameworks or definitions help you clarify conversations about AI?\n\nStep 5A: Hook directions\n- [Problem/solution] \"AI\" means something different to every team\n- [Beginner/expert clarity] Most people use \"AI\" to describe very different technologies\n- [Trend] The language of software keeps changing with each generation\n- [User phrasing] \"A problem with AI today is that it means different things to different people.\"\n\nStep 5B: Add notes\n- [Problem/solution] Miscommunication is common; breaking it into software \"generations\" helps\n- [Clarity] Quick framework to separate rule-based, statistical, and LLMs\n\nStep 5C: Choose the best direction\n- Go with clarity—factual, direct, useful breakdown\n\nDraft hook: \"'AI' can mean three completely different things, depending on who you ask.\"\n\nStep 6: Full draft\n'AI' can mean three completely different things, depending on who you ask.\n\nHere’s a basic breakdown I use to keep conversations clear:\n\n- Software 1.0: Rule-based systems (\"if this, then that\" logic; hard-coded by people)\n- Software 2.0: Machine learning (algorithms learn patterns from data and make predictions)\n- Software 3.0: Large Language Models (LLMs) (AI can generate, reason, and react to new input using huge datasets)\n\nA lot of confusion about \"AI\" comes from mixing up these categories. Defining terms first always helps.\n\nWhat other frameworks or definitions help you clarify conversations about AI?\n\nStep 7: Review\n- One em dash present (acceptable, clarifies parenthetical)\n- No clichés, no idioms\n- No tricolons with negation\n- Structure and tone match the example posts (e.g., Example 1, Example 4)\n\nStep 8: Final post below.",
