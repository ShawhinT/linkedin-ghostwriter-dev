  "input": "Share blog: compressing LLMs.\n\nSnippet: While the immense scale of LLMs is responsible for their impressive performance across a wide range of use cases, this presents challenges in their application to real-world problems. In this article, I discuss how we can overcome these challenges by compressing LLMs. I start with a high-level overview of key concepts and then walk through a concrete example with Python code.",
  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Share an educational blog post on compressing LLMs, highlight a practical approach, and invite technical readers to learn more.\n- Audience: AI engineers, practitioners, and anyone working with or interested in large language models (LLMs).\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n- Hook: Why LLM compression matters for real-world use.\n- Body: Briefly explain the challenges with large LLMs, what the blog covers (key concepts + Python example), and why it's valuable.\n- CTA: Invite readers to share their experiences with LLM compression.\n- Link: Place the blog link above the CTA.\n\nStep 3: Body\n- Large LLMs are powerful, but their size makes real-world deployment difficult.\n- The blog starts with a high-level overview of compression methods.\n- Includes a step-by-step Python example.\n- Practical guide for those working on deploying LLMs in production.\n\nStep 4: CTA\n- What compression methods or tools have you found most effective?\n\nStep 5: Brainstorm Hook Directions\nA. [Problem/solution] Deploying LLMs is hard because of their size. Want to make it practical?\nB. [Trend/urgency] Many talk about using LLMs, but few solve the size/performance challenge.\nC. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] Most tutorials skip the practical code example—this one doesn't.\nD. [User's own phrasing] \"While the immense scale of LLMs is responsible for their performance, this presents challenges...\"\n\nNotes:\nA. Highlights pain point + leads to solution\nB. Focuses on gap between talk and practice\nC. Emphasizes practical value\nD. Leverages provided snippet opening\n\nStep 6: Choose and Write Hook\n- Choosing A: \"Deploying LLMs is hard because of their size. Compressing them makes it practical.\"\n\nStep 7: Draft Full Post\n- Hook: Deploying LLMs is hard because of their size. Compressing them makes it practical.\n- Body: The immense scale of modern LLMs gives impressive performance but also creates real challenges for production use. My latest blog covers how to overcome these challenges through model compression. I start with a high-level overview of key techniques, then walk through a concrete Python example step-by-step. If you’re working on bringing LLMs into real applications, this practical guide can help.\n- Link to blog\n- CTA: What compression methods or tools have you found most effective?\n\nStep 8: Review for Style, Voice, Flow, and Em Dash Use\n- Only one em dash in the post, used for clarity in the hook.\n- Literal, practical, no business clichés or idioms.\n- Body matches educational, practical, action-oriented Shaw style.\n- CTA is factual and technical.\n- Clear white space and structure.\n\nFinal post below.",
