  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Share a clear, practical snapshot of the core AI tools and platforms Shaw currently relies on. Educate and invite others to share their go-to tools.\n- Audience: AI engineers, data scientists, developers, and entrepreneurs following Shaw for technical/process insights.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n[Hook: Direct headline or context on 2025 stack]\n[List of the tech stack tools]\n[Brief commentary: Why these? Common thread or purpose for each?]\n[CTA: Which tools are missing from this list?]\n\nStep 3: Body\n- Present the list of tools with brief clarifications if helpful.\n- Brief reflection: These are the tools I use daily/week-to-week. This set helps with everything from prototyping to collaboration and deployment.\n\nStep 4: CTA\n- What would you add to this stack?\n\nStep 5: The Hook\nStep 5A: Brainstorm labeled directions\n- [Simple list] \"My current AI tech stack (2025):\"\n- [Problem/solution] \"Building AI apps? Here are the only 7 tools I use.\"\n- [Personal context] \"After years of experimenting, here’s what stuck for my 2025 stack.\"\n- [Trend/clarifying] \"So many new AI tools—here are the ones I’m actually using daily.\"\nStep 5B: Add notes to each\n- [Simple list] Focuses on clarity, good for scannability\n- [Problem/solution] Positions as pared-down essentials\n- [Personal context] Validates that this isn’t hype\n- [Trend/clarifying] Nods to tool overload\nStep 5C: Chosen direction: [Trend/clarifying] — aligns with readers overwhelmed by new tools, and grounds in real usage.\nFinal hook: \"So many new AI tools—these are the ones I keep coming back to in 2025.\"\n\nStep 6: Draft Full Post\nSo many new AI tools—these are the ones I keep coming back to in 2025.\n\nMy current AI stack:\n\n- Python — scripting, API calls, quick experiments\n- Jupyter Lab — interactive development, prototyping\n- Cursor — AI-powered IDE\n- ChatGPT — rapid idea generation, code writing\n- OpenAI API — programmatic access to LLMs\n- Hugging Face — models, datasets, deployment\n- Sentence Transformers — text embeddings, similarity tasks\n- GitHub — code sharing and version control\n\nThis set covers most AI workflows I hit daily, from writing code to collaborating on projects.\n\nWhat would you add to this stack?\n\nStep 7: Style, Voice, and Flow Review\n✓ Direct, fact-based, educational\n✓ No business clichés or figurative language\n✓ Hook is observational, not hype or motivational\n✓ CTA is factual and focused\n✓ Uses one, justified em dash for clarity\n✓ White space and bullets for readability\n✓ Parallels example #5 and #1 in voice/style\n\nStep 8: Final Post",
