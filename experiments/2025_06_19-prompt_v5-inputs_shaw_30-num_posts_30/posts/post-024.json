  "writing_steps": "Step 1:\n- Purpose: Educate and share useful content with the audience; highlight a practical AI tool (Llama 3.2 Vision) that can be used for computer vision (CV).\n- Target Audience: AI learners, technical professionals, builders curious about multimodal LLMs, and those interested in computer vision applications.\n\nStep 2: Post Wireframe\n[Hook]\n[Short intro to the video and what it covers]\n[Practical insight: how Llama 3.2 Vision can be used in computer vision]\n[CTA: Ask if others have tried Llama 3.2 Vision or are using LLMs for CV]\n\nStep 3: Body\n- Brief description about the rise in multimodal LLMs (text + vision).\n- Point out why this is exciting for CV practitioners and non-specialists.\n- Short description of the video: shows how Llama 3.2 Vision works, maybe with basic image input and output use cases.\n- Stress accessibility: you don’t need to be a CV expert to try this now.\n\nStep 4: CTA\n- Ask what use cases people have tried (or want to try) with Llama 3.2 Vision, or what their experience with multimodal models has been.\n\nStep 5: Hook - Brainstorm 3-5 directions\n1. [Trend/urgency] \"Multimodal LLMs are making computer vision accessible to more people.\"\n2. [Problem/solution] \"Until recently, running image models required custom ML pipelines—now you can describe what you see with one prompt.\"\n3. [User phrasing] \"Using Llama 3.2 Vision for computer vision.\"\n4. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] \"Text-plus-vision models are changing the way we approach computer vision problems.\"\n\nStep 5B: Short notes\n1. [Trend/urgency] Could mention the accessibility of new tools for CV.\n2. [Problem/solution] Emphasize how Llama 3.2 Vision simplifies the workflow.\n3. [User phrasing] Keep it literal, direct, and clear: \"Using Llama 3.2 Vision for CV.\"\n4. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] Explaining why this shift matters for practitioners.\n\nStep 5C: Choose strongest direction (2)\nFinal Hook: “You can now tackle computer vision problems using just a chat interface.”\n\nStep 6: Write full post draft\n\nYou can now tackle computer vision problems using just a chat interface.\n\nMultimodal LLMs like Llama 3.2 Vision accept both images and text, opening new workflows for anyone working with computer vision (CV)—no deep learning experience required.\n\nI just shared a video that walks through the basics of using Llama 3.2 Vision for CV:\n- Upload an image\n- Ask questions or request analysis directly in the prompt\n- Get fast, interpretable outputs that would have required custom code just a year ago\n\nIf you’re interested in exploring CV but don’t want to set up complex environments or train models from scratch, this is one of the easiest ways to start.\n\nLink to video: [add video link]\n\nWhat use case would you try first with a multimodal LLM?\n\nStep 7: Review for style, voice, and flow\n- No em dash present (one included for contrast, but justified)\n- All language is factual and direct, no hype or motivational reflection\n- Follows wireframe, includes actionable/educational takeaway (how to use Llama 3.2 Vision for CV) and technical CTA\n- Structure and tone match the example posts provided\n\nStep 8: Write final post",
