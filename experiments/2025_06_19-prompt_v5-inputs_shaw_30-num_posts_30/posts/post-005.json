Here’s a simple approach you can use today:\n\n1. Choose your language or stack (Python is common for most beginners)\n2. Identify a task you want to automate (e.g., email sorting, summarizing articles)\n3. Pick a foundational model (like OpenAI’s GPT or similar API)\n4. Write the script to input, process, and output data using the model’s API\n5. Set up basic evaluation: run sample inputs and review outputs\n6. Refine your prompt and add simple logic to improve reliability\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhat beginner-friendly AI frameworks or tools have you found most helpful?\n\nStep 5: Hook ideation\nA. [User’s own phrasing] “By the end of this post, you’ll be able to build your first AI agent”\nB. [Problem/Solution] “Most beginners are confused about where to start with agents. Here’s a direct, 6-step process.”\nC. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “You don’t need a huge team or advanced math to build a useful AI agent.”\nD. [How-to] “How to build your first AI agent, even if you’re new to coding.”\nE. [Trend/urgency] “AI agents are everywhere. Here’s how to join in.”\n\nStep 6: Choose Hook\n[Beginner-to-expert clarity] \"You don’t need a huge team or advanced math to build a useful AI agent.\"\n\nStep 7: Draft the full post\n\nYou don’t need a huge team or advanced math to build a useful AI agent.\n\nHere’s a simple way to get started:\n\n1. Pick your programming language (Python is the default for most people)\n2. Decide on a task you want to automate (like sorting emails or summarizing blog posts)\n3. Get access to a model API (OpenAI’s GPT is a popular choice)\n4. Write a basic script to input data, send it to the model, and collect the output\n5. Test with sample inputs and review the outputs for quality\n6. Iterate by adjusting prompts or adding rules for reliability\n\nBuilding a basic agent is often easier than people expect once you break it into clear steps.\n\nWhat beginner-friendly AI tools or frameworks would you recommend?\n\nStep 8: Review and finalize\n- One em dash used (none extra)\n- No metaphors, business clichés, or motivational language present\n- CTA is practical and singular\n- Body is actionable and educational\n- Voice is clear, direct, and in Shaw’s style",
