  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose and Audience\n- Purpose: Provide a clear, step-by-step learning path for newcomers to AI in 2025.\n- Audience: Beginners interested in getting started with AI, either self-learners or career switchers.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n[Hook]\n[Ordered steps: how to start learning AI from zero, breaking down each step]\n[Direct call to action: Ask for practical additions to the list]\n\nStep 3: Body\n- Lay out structured steps for learning AI:\n    - Use ChatGPT (or other LLM assistants) to accelerate learning\n    - Install Python (the core language for AI projects)\n    - Build a simple automation (like a bot or script)\n    - Make a beginner ML project (e.g., simple classifier, using libraries)\n    - Tackle a real-world advanced project (e.g., data pipeline, agent, app)\n\nStep 4: CTA\n- Practical: “What would you add to this roadmap?”\n\nStep 5: Hook Exploration and Selection\nDirections:\n1. [User’s own phrasing] “How I’d learn AI in 2025 (if I knew nothing)”\n2. [Problem/solution] “Most new AI learners don’t know what to focus on—here’s a simple roadmap.”\n3. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “It’s easy to get overwhelmed starting with AI. Here’s a clear path.”\n4. [Numbered list] “5 steps to go from zero to building advanced AI projects in 2025”\n5. [Results/outcomes] “Start from zero and end with your own AI app: here’s a stepwise approach.”\n\nEvaluating, #1 (user’s own phrasing) is strong and direct, matching the intended audience and Shaw’s style.\n\nStep 6: Draft\nHow I’d learn AI in 2025 (if I knew nothing)\n\nThere’s a lot of noise out there, but here’s the straightforward path I’d follow:\n\n1) Use ChatGPT (or your preferred LLM) as a study companion. Get help with explanations, examples, and coding problems.\n2) Install Python. Most modern AI projects start here. Use tools like Anaconda or Miniconda for easier setup.\n3) Build a beginner automation—this could be a script that organizes files or pulls data from the internet.\n4) Take on a small machine learning project: try classifying text, images, or numbers using open-source libraries like scikit-learn or Hugging Face.\n5) For advanced practice, build a real-world project. This might involve setting up a data pipeline, deploying an agent, or launching a simple AI web app.\n\nWhat would you add to this roadmap?\n\nStep 7: Review\n- Em dash count: None\n- Literal, direct language (no metaphors, no business clichés)\n- Practical, stepwise advice\n- CTA is clear and practical\n- Format uses white space and bullets for scannability\n- Tone is peer-oriented, clear, confident\n\nStep 8: Final Post",
  "final_post": "How I’d learn AI in 2025 (if I knew nothing)\n\nThere’s a lot of noise out there, but here’s the path I’d take:\n\n1️⃣ Use ChatGPT (or any LLM) as a study companion. Ask for explanations, code samples, and troubleshooting help.\n\n2️⃣ Install Python. It’s the main language for AI work—use Anaconda or Miniconda to skip common setup headaches.\n\n3️⃣ Build a beginner automation project. Start with something simple, like a script that organizes your downloads or sends scheduled emails.\n\n4️⃣ Make a basic ML project: use scikit-learn or Hugging Face to classify text, images, or numbers.\n\n5️⃣ Move to a real-world project. Try setting up a basic data pipeline, deploying a simple agent, or launching an AI-powered app.\n\nWhat would you add to this roadmap?"
