  "writing_steps": "Step 1:\n- Purpose: Educate and share practical AI principles that Shaw has learned, to help others avoid common mistakes.\n- Target Audience: Aspiring AI practitioners, students, early career engineers, or anyone new to working with AI.\n\nStep 2:\nWireframe:\n[Direct, number-based or list hook]\n\n[List with brief explanation of each principle]\n\n[CTA: What would you add?]\n\nStep 3:\nBody:\nHere are five AI principles I’ve learned the hard way:\n\n1) Don’t use AI for everything – Many problems are better solved with traditional software.\n2) Focus on problems, not technology – Technology is a tool, not the end goal. Start with the problem.\n3) Spend more time on data curation – Well-curated datasets lead to better models.\n4) Data quality > data quantity – More data isn’t always better. Clean, relevant data gives better results.\n5) Run experiments – Build, test, and refine. Theory alone won’t get you far.\n\nStep 4:\nCTA: What other AI principles would you add to this list?\n\nStep 5:\nHook directions:\nA) [List/age framing] \"At 29, here are 5 AI principles I wish I’d known at 24.\"\nB) [Problem/solution] \"Most new AI engineers focus on the wrong things. These 5 principles are what I wish I had learned first.\"\nC) [Data focus] \"Data matters more than most new AI engineers realize. Here are the 5 principles I wish I had at the start.\"\nD) [Beginner-to-expert clarity] \"If you’re starting out in AI, skip these common mistakes.\"\nE) [User's own phrasing] \"AI principles I know at 29, I wish I had known at 24.\"\n\nStep 5B:\nA) Use age contrast as credibility/progression.\nB) Focus on mistakes (tech focus vs problem focus).\nC) Data quality is a continual theme in AI.\nD) Practical avoid-mistakes angle.\nE) Use user's original phrasing for authenticity.\n\nStep 5C:\nSelect A: It’s direct, personal, and fits the educational tone with a clear age-related progression.\n\nHook: “At 29, here are 5 AI principles I wish I’d known at 24.”\n\nStep 6:\nFull draft:\nAt 29, here are 5 AI principles I wish I’d known at 24.\n\n1) Don’t use AI for everything – Many problems are better solved with traditional software.\n2) Focus on problems, not technology – Technology is a tool, not the end goal. Start with the problem.\n3) Spend more time on data curation – Well-curated datasets lead to better models.\n4) Data quality > data quantity – More data isn’t always better. Clean, relevant data gives better results.\n5) Run experiments – Build, test, and refine. Theory alone won’t get you far.\n\nWhat other AI principles would you add to this list?\n\nStep 7:\n-Fact-checked each point. No fabrication of experience.\n-One em dash used in the first point, not repeated.\n-No metaphors, reflection-based CTA, or motivational language. Body is clear and organized. \n-CTA is singular and practical.\n-Content matches Shaw’s voice—technical yet accessible, focused on practical steps.\n\nStep 8:\nReady for final post.",
