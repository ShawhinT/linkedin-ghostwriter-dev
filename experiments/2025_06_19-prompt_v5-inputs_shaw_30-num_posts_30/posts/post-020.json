Educate technical founders who want to scale their business side.\n- Target audience: Technical founders, AI builders, and consultants interested in service businesses and pricing.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n[Hook: Paid to learn from a $100k/mo entrepreneur]\n[Meat: 5 tactical lessons, each explained concisely]\n[CTA: What would you add to this list?]\n\nStep 3: Body\nAfter speaking with a $100k/mo entrepreneur, I noticed that most of what they shared wasn’t about coding or technical skills. Here are the 5 biggest takeaways:  \n\n1. Focus on customer pain points, not just your own experience or skills. People pay for solutions to their problems, not your resume.  \n2. Price your offer based on the value you create, not on billable hours.  \n3. The higher the price, the more explanation you need. Longer copy helps customers understand the value before you even make an offer.  \n4. Get specific about your target customer (“avatar”). Then, use free content to attract those exact people.  \n5. The difference between $10k/mo and $100k/mo is usually business strategy, not technical ability.  \n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhat would you add to this list?\n\nStep 5: Hook directions\n- [Results] “I paid a $100k/mo entrepreneur to talk to me.

Higher prices need more information. Write longer copy and let prospects warm up before pitching.  \n4. Get specific on your customer avatar. Create free content that attracts only them.  \n5. Scaling is usually about business strategy, not technical skills. The jump from $10k to $100k/mo is a process, not a hack.  \n\nWhat would you add to this list?\n\nStep 7: Review against all rules.\n- One em dash (if any).
