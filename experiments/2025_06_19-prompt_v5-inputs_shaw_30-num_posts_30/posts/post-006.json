Stress factual, practical steps.\n- [Problem/solution] — \"Here’s what most don’t tell you about actually making your first $70k.\"\n- [Trend/urgency] — Show which methods worked vs. noise; practical differentiation.\n- [Beginner-to-expert] — Advice I’d give to someone at $0 knowing what I know now.\n- [User’s phrasing] — Direct, but less compelling than highlighting what’s behind the number.\n\nStep 5C: \nChose the [Results/outcomes] direction for the hook, since $0 to $70k is factual and a direct draw for peers.\n\nStep 6: Full Draft\n\nHow I reached $70k as an AI educator and entrepreneur—here’s the real breakdown.\n\nGetting from $0 to $70k wasn’t about hacks or trends.

Having real relationships led to several new clients.\n4. Defining a specific target customer made it much easier to monetize. When I got clear on who I wanted to help, sales followed.\n\nI’m happy to break down any of these in detail for anyone interested.\n\nWhich would you want to see explained step by step next?\n\nStep 7: Review\n- Did not use more than one em dash (used only once, justified for clarity in the hook)\n- Hook is factual and clear, not a rephrase of the body\n- Language is literal—no business clichés or hype\n- CTA is focused and practical\n- Cross-checked with example posts for style and structure\n\nStep 8: Final Post",
