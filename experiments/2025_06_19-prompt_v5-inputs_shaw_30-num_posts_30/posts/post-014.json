  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose and Audience\n- Purpose: Share a video resource on fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using MLX. Educate and surface a useful resource/tool for people working with AI models.\n- Audience: AI engineers, ML practitioners, and developers interested in LLMs and tooling.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n[Teasing utility of the resource]\n[What the video/tool covers and who it's for]\n[Link to video]\n[Practical CTA: ask what resources readers use or feedback on MLX]\n\nStep 3: Body (Meat)\nMLX is becoming a go-to library for running and fine-tuning LLMs on Apple hardware. If you’re looking to get started with hands-on fine-tuning, this video breaks down the practical steps using MLX from setup to training a model.\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhat other LLM fine-tuning tools or workflows have you found useful?\n\nStep 5: Hook Directions\nA. [Tool spotlight]: Fine-tuning LLMs on Mac just got easier\nB. [Direct question]: Are you using MLX for LLMs yet?\nC. [How-to]: How to fine-tune LLMs with MLX (step-by-step video)\nD. [Community angle]: Sharing an underrated resource for LLM fine-tuning on Apple hardware\nE. [User’s phrasing]: Fine-tuning LLMs with MLX\n\nStep 5B: Notes\nA. Highlight the accessibility and newness for Mac/MLX users.\nB. Engage developers familiar with Mac or looking for new tools.\nC. Direct, practical, with a how-to angle for hands-on readers.\nD. Invite community participation and sharing resources.\nE. User’s phrasing: direct and to-the-point.\n\nStep 5C: Pick the best direction: A (Tool spotlight) is clear and relevant for Shaw’s audience.\n\nFinal Hook: Fine-tuning LLMs on Mac just got easier with MLX.\n\nStep 6: Draft Post\nFine-tuning LLMs on Mac just got easier with MLX.\n\nMLX is becoming a go-to library for running and fine-tuning large language models on Apple hardware. If you want to get started with hands-on fine-tuning, this video covers the process using MLX—from setup to training a model.\n\nCheck out the video here: [insert video link]\n\nWhat other LLM fine-tuning tools or workflows have you found useful?\n\nStep 7: Review\n- One em dash present (“—”). Used for flow and clarity.\n- No repeated hook/body lines.\n- Practical, not motivational or reflective.\n- Stepwise process and factual tone match style examples.\n- CTA is specific and singular.\n- No clichés, idioms, or figurative language.\n- Cross-checked with Examples 1 & 5: aligns with sharing resources and educational tools.\n\nStep 8: Final Post",
