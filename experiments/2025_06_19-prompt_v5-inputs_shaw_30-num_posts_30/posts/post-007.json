  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose and Audience\n- Purpose: Educate and inspire readers with quick, practical AI project ideas (showing how accessible AI projects can be for those willing to experiment).\n- Target audience: Aspiring AI engineers, technical freelancers, students, and solopreneurs interested in fast prototyping or building AI skills through hands-on projects.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n- Hook: Factual, curiosity-driven one-liner calling out exactly what readers will get.\n- List the 5 projects, each with a short, practical note about what the project does or involves.\n- CTA: Invite readers to add their own fast AI project ideas.\n\nStep 3: Body \n\nHere are 5 AI projects you can spin up in less than an hour:\n\n1) PDF summarization tool\nUse an LLM API (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude) and a basic Python script to extract and summarize text from a PDF.\n\n2) Customer review clustering\nApply KMeans (via scikit-learn) to group product reviews by topic or sentiment—great for fast product feedback analysis.\n\n3) Document QA chatbot\nConnect a pre-trained chatbot (like LangChain or Haystack) to your own docs for instant question-answering.\n\n4) YouTube comment sentiment analysis\nPull recent comments from a channel using the YouTube Data API, then run them through a sentiment classifier (Hugging Face models work well here).\n\n5) Gmail inbox categorization\nUse Gmail's API and some basic NLP filtering to tag or sort emails by project, urgency, or sender—all with Python.\n\nStep 4: CTA\n- What would you add to this list?\n\nStep 5: Brainstorm Hooks (with labeled directions)\n\n[User's phrasing] \"5 AI projects you can build in (less than) an hour\"\n[Beginner-to-expert clarity] \"Most people think AI projects take days—here's what you can build in under an hour\"\n[Problem/solution] \"No time for big projects? These 5 mini-AI builds get you results fast\"\n[Action-oriented] \"Need an AI side project? Try one of these 5 in your next lunch break\"\n[Results] \"5 projects, 1 hour each—here’s what you’ll finish by dinnertime\"\n\nStep 5B: Expand on each direction\n\n- User’s phrasing: Clear, literal headline\n- Beginner-to-expert: People overestimate complexity/time for AI projects; here are simple ones you can do quickly\n- Problem/solution: For people short on time, these are practical and fast, immediate benefit\n- Action: For someone who wants to get hands-on; easy projects with practical outcomes\n- Results: Teases how quickly something tangible can be built\n\nStep 5C: Choose the strongest direction\nI’ll go with a hybrid between user’s phrasing and the beginner-to-expert clarity, since it immediately challenges a misconception and offers clear value.\n\nHook: “Most people overestimate the time it takes to build with AI. You can finish any of these 5 projects in under an hour.”\n\nStep 6: Assemble the post\n\n[Hook]\nMost people overestimate the time it takes to build with AI. You can finish any of these 5 projects in under an hour.\n\n[Meat]\nHere are 5 practical builds for rapid skill development:\n\n1) PDF summarization tool\nUse an LLM API and a quick Python script to summarize long PDFs automatically.\n\n2) Customer review clustering\nGroup customer reviews by topic or sentiment using KMeans (scikit-learn) in just a few lines of code.\n\n3) Document QA chatbot\nConnect a pre-trained chatbot to your own docs for instant Q&A (tools like LangChain or Haystack make this quick).\n\n4) YouTube comment sentiment analysis\nPull comments with the YouTube Data API, then run sentiment analysis using a Hugging Face pipeline.\n\n5) Gmail inbox categorization\nTag or sort your emails with simple NLP filters and Gmail’s API—all in Python.\n\n[CTA]\nWhat would you add to this list?\n\nStep 7: Review for style, voice, and flow\n- Satisfies em dash rule (zero em dashes)\n- No business clichés, idioms, or motivational language\n- Factual, clear, and practical\n- CTA is focused and does not use \"or/and”\n- Follows Shaw’s example post format\n\nStep 8: Final Post",
