  "writing_steps": "Step 1: \nPurpose: Share a resource that will help AI practitioners build LLMs for production (educational/content share).\nAudience: LLM builders, engineers, and AI practitioners interested in deploying and scaling LLMs.\n\nStep 2:\nWireframe:\n[Hook: Direct announcement of valuable resource for LLM practitioners]\n[Meat: Briefly explain what the guide is, who it's for, and key focus (building LLMs for production).]\n[CTA: Ask for other favorite resources for LLM deployment or production engineering.]\n\nStep 3:\nBody:\nIf you’re working with large language models and need guidance on building for production, here’s a comprehensive resource. \n\nThe \"Super Study Guide: Transformers & Large Language Models (LLMs)\" covers the practical side of deploying, scaling, and maintaining LLM applications. It aims to help LLM practitioners move from prototype to deployed solution efficiently.\n\nStep 4:\nCTA: What other resources have you found valuable for LLM deployment?\n\nStep 5:\nHook brainstorm directions:\n1. [Resource announcement] New guide for building LLMs in production—\n2. [Problem/solution] Most LLM guides focus on theory, but here’s a practical approach for production.\n3. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] A step-by-step study guide for large language model development at scale.\n4. [User’s own phrasing] Book share: Super Study Guide: Transformers & Large Language Models.\n\nNotes for each direction:\n1. Makes it clear this is for people shipping LLMs.\n2. Contrasts with the theoretical nature of many resources.\n3. Signals depth and practicality.\n4. Very factual, but lacks specificity about why it matters.\n\nPick direction 1 for clarity and relevance.\n\nFinal Hook: If you want a practical guide to building LLMs for production, this book covers the key steps.\n\nStep 6:\nDraft post:\nIf you want a practical guide to building LLMs for production, this book covers the key steps.\n\nThe \"Super Study Guide: Transformers & Large Language Models (LLMs)\" is designed for practitioners. It outlines deployment, scaling, and maintenance workflows for LLM apps. If you build or operationalize LLMs, this resource could speed up your process.\n\nWhat other resources have you found valuable for LLM deployment?\n\nStep 7:\n- Only one em dash (in hook direction, not in final post).\n- Literal language.\n- Clear, practical CTA.\n- Follows Shaw’s structure and voice: direct, factual, and invites practical/technical engagement.\n\nStep 8:\nWrite the final post.",
