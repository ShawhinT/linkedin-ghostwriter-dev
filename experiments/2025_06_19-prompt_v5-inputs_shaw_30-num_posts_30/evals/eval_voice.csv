Step 2: Check for red flags. This post uses a stepwise list (1-3), which is consistent with Shaw's style. The language is clear and literal, with no idioms, business jargon, or motivational catchphrases. The engagement prompt is factual and at the end. However, the list items use the format ""Use stories,"" ""Use examples,"" and ""Use analogies,"" which is slightly more generic than Shaw's typical style, but not outside his range.

He avoids idioms, business jargon, motivational punchlines, and generic engagement prompts. Resource announcements typically include a clear breakdown of what the resource covers.

Step 2: Check for red flags. 
- The opener is factual and curiosity-driven, which fits Shaw's style.
- The post does not use idioms, business jargon, or motivational catchphrases.
- The structure is hook (LLMs aren’t the only models advancing fast—here’s how I used FLUX.1 for unlimited images of myself), problem/observation (Most of the recent AI hype is focused on language models, but image-generation models are making big leaps too...), and solution/resource (I just fine-tuned FLUX.1... In my latest blog, I share the full process: ...).

He follows a hook → problem/observation → solution/resource structure, and ends with a factual engagement prompt.

Step 2: Check for red flags. The post opens with a factual observation about technical debt in AI projects, then presents two practical checks in a numbered list. The language is clear and literal, with no idioms, business jargon, or motivational catchphrases. The examples are formatted as numbered points, matching Shaw's style.

post-018,True,"Step 1: Summarize Shaw's style. Shaw's posts are factual, practical, and educational, often using clear, stepwise lists or frameworks. He opens with a factual or curiosity-driven hook, explains the problem or why it matters, and then provides a solution or resource. He avoids idioms, business jargon, and motivational punchlines, and ends with a factual engagement prompt.

Step 2: Check for red flags. This post opens with a factual, practical hook. The explanation of Python's role in AI is clear and literal, with no idioms or business jargon. The post explains the problem (resources are too broad or assume prior knowledge) and the solution (a blog with essential skills and stepwise code examples). The engagement prompt is factual and at the end. There are no motivational catchphrases, tricolons, or summarizing punchlines. The example formatting is standard (parentheses for libraries), and the tone is practical and educational.

post-014,False,"Step 1: Summarize Shaw's style. Shaw's posts are factual, practical, and educational, often using a clear hook-problem-solution structure. He avoids idioms, business jargon, and motivational language, and typically provides context or a stepwise breakdown for resources. Engagement prompts are factual and at the end.

Step 2: Check for red flags. The post opens with a factual statement and provides a brief description of MLX and its use case. It announces a video resource but does not provide a stepwise breakdown or specific details about what the viewer will learn, only a general description ('from setup to training a model'). The engagement prompt is factual and at the end. There are no idioms, business jargon, or motivational phrases. However, the post skips the 'problem' or 'why it matters' step and jumps from hook to solution/resource, which is not typical of Shaw's style. The explanation of the resource is somewhat generic and lacks the concrete, stepwise breakdown Shaw usually provides for resource announcements.

Step 3: Weigh red flags against overall structure. The post is practical and factual, but the lack of a clear problem/observation and the absence of a stepwise breakdown for the resource are notable deviations. The post is not salesy, emotional, or motivational, and the engagement prompt is in the correct place.

Step 4: Cross-reference with examples. Shaw's resource announcements typically include a bullet list or clear breakdown of what the resource covers (e.g., 'Here’s what you can expect to get from the session' or 'Here’s what that has consisted of: 1)...'). This post does not do that, making it less informative and less in Shaw's style. The structure is closer to a generic resource share than Shaw's more detailed, educational approach.

Step 5: Final check. The post contains two minor deviations: (1) lack of a problem/observation step, and (2) lack of a stepwise breakdown or clear explanation of the resource's contents. These together make the post feel less educational and less on-brand for Shaw, even though the tone is factual and practical. The overall feel is more generic and less value-driven than Shaw's typical posts."
post-002,False,"Step 1: Summarize Shaw's style. Shaw's posts are practical, educational, and structured, often using lists or frameworks. He avoids idioms, motivational catchphrases, and business jargon. His posts follow a hook → problem/observation → solution/resource structure, and end with a factual engagement prompt. He uses clear, literal language and rarely uses playful metaphors or emojis.

Step 2: Identify red flags. This post opens with a personal reflection (""At 29, here are 5 AI principles I wish I’d known at 24.""), which is not uncommon for Shaw, as he sometimes shares personal lessons. The list is practical and clear, matching Shaw's style. However, point 5 ends with a tricolon with negation: ""Build, test, and refine — theory alone isn’t enough."" This is a summarizing punchline using asyndetic parallelism with negation and an em-dash, which is a strong red flag. Shaw typically avoids this structure and would let the list stand on its own or end with a factual statement. The engagement prompt at the end is factual and in the correct place.

Step 3: Weigh red flags against overall structure. The post is otherwise practical, educational, and clear, with a stepwise list and a factual engagement prompt. The only major deviation is the summarizing tricolon with negation and the em-dash in point 5.

Step 4: Cross-reference with examples. Shaw's lists do not end with a summarizing punchline or tricolon with negation. He avoids this rhetorical device, as seen in the negative examples. The rest of the post is on-brand.

Step 5: Final check. The presence of a summarizing tricolon with negation and an em-dash in a punchline is a strong red flag and is not characteristic of Shaw's style, even if the rest of the post is otherwise consistent. This is a major deviation that changes the overall feel of the post."

The list is literal and clear, not motivational or filled with idioms. There are no business clichés, idioms, or tricolons. The closing sentence is a factual engagement prompt. There is no excessive use of rhetorical questions, no asyndetic parallelism, and no salesy or emotional appeals.

Step 2a: Special considerations.

Step 2: Check for red flags. This post opens with a factual, curiosity-driven hook and follows with a clear, stepwise list. Each step is practical and concrete. There is one minor idiom ('skip common setup headaches'), but it is not a business cliché or motivational phrase. The list is literal and actionable. The engagement prompt is factual and at the end. There are no tricolons, no motivational punchlines, and no excessive rhetorical questions. The example formatting is consistent with Shaw's style (e.g., 'like a script that...').

Step 2a: Special considerations. The phrase 'skip common setup headaches' is a minor deviation, as Shaw typically uses more literal language, but it is not a strong idiom or cliché. The rest of the post is highly consistent with Shaw's style. There are no cumulative minor deviations that would change the overall tone or clarity.

Step 3: Weigh red flags. The single minor idiom does not outweigh the otherwise strong alignment with Shaw's style. The post is practical, educational, and follows the expected structure.

Step 2: Check for red flags. The post opens with a factual statement, which is on-brand. It announces a blog post, but does provide a brief summary of what's inside (data prep, training, evaluation, code snippets, explanations). However, it does not include a stepwise breakdown or bullet list of what the resource covers—just a single sentence summary.

He avoids idioms, business jargon, motivational punchlines, and generic phrasing. His example formatting uses 'e.g.' and his posts rarely use more than one emoji or playful metaphor.

Step 2: Check for red flags. The post opens with a factual observation and a personal statement about AI tools. It presents a clear, stepwise list of tools, each with a brief, literal explanation of its use. There are no idioms, business jargon, or motivational phrases. The example formatting is not 'e.g.' but the list is clear and concrete. The post ends with a factual engagement prompt ('What would you add to this stack?'). There is no summarizing tricolon, punchline, or motivational close. No excessive em-dashes, rhetorical questions, or salesy language.

Step 3: Weigh red flags against overall structure. The only minor deviation is the use of 'These are the ones I keep coming back to in 2025,' which is slightly more conversational than Shaw's typical opener, but not off-brand. The rest of the post is highly consistent with Shaw's style: practical, educational, clear, and structured.

Step 4: Cross-reference with examples. Shaw has made similar posts listing tools or resources, with brief explanations and a factual engagement prompt. The structure and tone are consistent with his style.

Step 5: Final check. The post provides clear value, follows a hook-problem-solution structure (hook: new tools, problem: which to use, solution: my stack), and ends with a factual engagement prompt. There are no cumulative minor deviations that change the overall feel or clarity of the post. It sounds like Shaw."
post-001,True,"Step 1: Summarize Shaw's style. Shaw's posts are practical, educational, and structured, often using clear lists or frameworks. He avoids idioms, business clichés, and motivational language, and his posts typically follow a hook → problem/observation → solution/resource structure. Engagement prompts are factual and at the end.

Step 2: Check for red flags. The post uses a numbered list, which is consistent with Shaw's style. The hook is factual and practical. The list items are clear and literal, with no idioms, business jargon, or motivational catchphrases. The use of an em-dash in point 1 is acceptable (only one, not in a punchline). The engagement prompt is factual and at the end. There is no summarizing tricolon or punchline. The post does not use informal example formatting (e.g., 'think:').

Step 3: Weigh red flags against overall structure. There are no major or minor red flags. The post is practical, educational, and follows Shaw's typical structure.

Step 4: Cross-reference with examples. Shaw has made similar posts with lists of ways to use AI or monetize skills, and the structure and tone here are consistent with those examples.

Step 5: Final check. The post provides clear value, follows the expected structure, and contains no idioms, clichés, or motivational language. It is on-brand for Shaw.

Conclusion: The post sounds like Shaw Talebi."
post-021,True,"Step 1: Summarize Shaw's style. Shaw's posts are factual, practical, and educational, often using clear lists or frameworks. He uses a hook-problem-solution structure, provides context for why something matters, and ends with a factual engagement prompt. He avoids idioms, business jargon, motivational punchlines, and generic phrasing. His examples are formatted with 'e.g.' and his posts rarely use informal example markers like 'think:'.

Step 2: Check for red flags. The post opens with a factual statement and provides a clear, itemized breakdown of revenue sources, which is consistent with Shaw's style. Each source is explained with a short, literal description. The sentence 'Diversifying income made each source less stressful to manage, and recurring freelance work was the most consistent.' is factual and not motivational or idiomatic. The engagement prompt ('What would you want a deeper breakdown on?') is factual and at the end. There are no idioms, business clichés, or motivational punchlines. There is no excessive use of rhetorical questions, tricolons, or asyndetic parallelism. Example formatting is not informal.

Step 3: Weigh red flags against overall structure. There are no significant or minor red flags. The post is practical, educational, and follows Shaw's typical structure.

Step 4: Cross-reference with examples. Shaw has a very similar post ('Breaking down my first $10k month (as an entrepreneur)') that uses a nearly identical structure and tone, with a factual breakdown and a factual engagement prompt at the end.

post-006,True,"Step 1: Summarize Shaw's style. Shaw's posts are factual, practical, and educational, often using clear, stepwise lists or frameworks. His openers are usually factual or curiosity-driven, sometimes lightly playful, but rarely motivational. He avoids idioms, business clichés, and overtly motivational punchlines. He uses a hook-problem-solution structure and ends with a factual engagement prompt.

Step 2: Check for red flags. 
- The opener uses a summarizing tricolon with a dash: 'How I reached $70k as an AI educator and entrepreneur—here’s the real breakdown.' This is a minor red flag, as Shaw rarely uses summarizing tricolons or dashes in this way, but it's not a major deviation.
- The post avoids idioms, business clichés, and motivational catchphrases. The language is clear and literal.
- The list is stepwise and practical, matching Shaw's style.
- The closing sentence is a factual engagement prompt: 'Which lesson would you want to see explained step by step next?'
- There is one em-dash in the opener, which is within the acceptable limit.
- No excessive rhetorical questions, no salesy language, and no direct emotional appeals.

Step 3: Weigh red flags against overall structure. The only minor deviation is the use of a summarizing tricolon in the opener, but the rest of the post is highly consistent with Shaw's style: practical, educational, clear, and ending with a factual engagement prompt.

Step 4: Cross-reference with examples. Shaw has shared posts breaking down income and lessons learned (see the $10k month example), using stepwise lists and factual engagement prompts. The structure and tone here are very similar.

Step 5: Final check. The post is practical, educational, and clear, with only a minor deviation in the opener. There are not two or more minor deviations, and the overall feel is on-brand. Therefore, this post sounds like Shaw."
post-010,False,"Step 1: Summarize Shaw's style. Shaw's posts are practical, educational, and structured with a hook, problem/observation, and solution/resource. He avoids idioms, motivational catchphrases, and business jargon. His posts end with a factual engagement prompt, not a motivational punchline. He uses clear, literal language and stepwise lists or frameworks.

Step 2: Identify red flags. The post opens with a rhetorical contrast: 'You can measure wealth in dollars—but that’s only a small part of the picture.' This is a persuasive tricolon with negation, which is not typical for Shaw. The phrase 'only a small part of the picture' is a common idiom. The post continues with 'A bank account only captures one kind of value. Skills, knowledge, and how quickly you learn are just as important...'—this is a summarizing tricolon, again not typical for Shaw. The sentence 'learning isn’t optional. It’s how you stay relevant and spot new opportunities.' is motivational and generic, not factual or technical. The post also uses a personal anecdote ('I invest more time learning new tools...'), which Shaw sometimes does, but here it is framed in a motivational, life-lesson style. The closing engagement prompt is factual and at the end, which is on-brand.

Step 3: Weigh red flags. The post contains multiple red flags: idiomatic language ('only a small part of the picture'), summarizing tricolons, a motivational/life-lesson tone, and a persuasive structure. These are not characteristic of Shaw's style, even though the engagement prompt is on-brand.

Step 4: Cross-reference with examples. Shaw's posts avoid idioms and summarizing tricolons, and his personal anecdotes are usually tied to specific, practical lessons or frameworks, not general motivational advice. The negative examples in the instructions highlight that posts with these elements are not in Shaw's voice.

Step 5: Final check. The cumulative effect of idiomatic language, summarizing tricolons, and a motivational tone means this post does not sound like Shaw, even though the engagement prompt is on-brand."
