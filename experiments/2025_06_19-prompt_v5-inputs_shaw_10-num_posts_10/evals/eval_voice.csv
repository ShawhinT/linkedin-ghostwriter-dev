post-002,True,"Step 1: Summarize Shaw's style. Shaw's posts are practical, educational, and structured, often using lists or frameworks.

post-003,False,"Step 1: Summarize Shaw's style from the examples. Shaw's posts are practical, educational, and structured with a hook, a problem/observation, and a solution/resource. He avoids idioms, motivational catchphrases, and business jargon. His posts are factual, use clear lists or frameworks, and end with a factual engagement prompt.

Step 2: Check for red flags. This post opens with a tricolon with negation ('aren’t more intelligent—they just build more projects'), which is a persuasive structure Shaw avoids. The phrase 'the key factor is action' is somewhat motivational, and the sentence 'You don’t need special talent to follow this. You just need to start and finish a project this week.' is a generic motivational punchline, which is not typical of Shaw's style. The post also uses a summarizing tricolon ('Pick a small, clear problem / Build a working solution / Share your result / Take notes, iterate, and repeat'), which is more motivational than Shaw's usual stepwise, factual lists. The overall tone is more motivational and less educational than Shaw's typical posts.

Step 3: Weigh red flags against structure and value. While the post does provide a stepwise list and ends with an engagement prompt, the presence of motivational language, a tricolon with negation, and a generic punchline are significant deviations from Shaw's style. The post lacks the clear, factual, and educational tone that characterizes Shaw's writing.

Step 4: Cross-reference with examples. Shaw's posts avoid motivational punchlines and tricolons with negation. His lists are factual and practical, not motivational. The closing sentence here is motivational, not a factual engagement prompt.

Step 5: Final check. The cumulative effect of the tricolon with negation, motivational tone, and punchline means this post does not sound like Shaw Talebi."
post-001,True,"Step 1: Summarize Shaw's style. Shaw's posts are practical, educational, and structured, often using clear lists or frameworks. He avoids idioms, business jargon, and motivational catchphrases. His posts typically follow a hook → problem/observation → solution/resource structure, and end with a factual engagement prompt.

Step 2: Check for red flags. This post uses a numbered list, which is consistent with Shaw's style. The language is clear and literal, with no idioms, business jargon, or motivational phrases. The engagement prompt is factual and at the end. The examples are formatted in a straightforward way (not using 'think:' or informal markers). There is no excessive use of rhetorical questions, tricolons, or asyndetic parallelism. The post does not use a summarizing punchline or motivational close.

Step 3: Weigh red flags against overall structure. There are no significant red flags. The post is practical, educational, and follows a clear structure. The list is stepwise and concrete, and the engagement prompt is on-brand.

Step 4: Cross-reference with examples. Shaw has several posts that use similar list structures to break down options or concepts (e.g., '7 Basic AI Terms (Simply) Explained…', '25 AI Buzzwords Explained for Entrepreneurs'). The tone and structure are consistent with these examples.

Step 5: Final check. The post provides clear value, follows Shaw's typical structure, and contains no style deviations. It sounds like Shaw."
post-006,False,"Step 1: Summarize Shaw's style. Shaw's posts are practical, educational, and structured with a clear hook, problem/observation, and solution/resource. He avoids idioms, motivational catchphrases, and business jargon. His posts rarely use summarizing punchlines or tricolons, and engagement prompts are factual and at the end.

Step 2: Check for red flags. The post opens with a summarizing tricolon: 'How I went from 0 to $70k—here’s what I learned.' This is a punchy, motivational-style opener, which is not typical for Shaw. The list is practical, but point 1 uses a tricolon with negation ('feedback matters more than getting it perfect'), which is a persuasive tricolon. Point 5 also uses a summarizing tricolon ('The biggest gains came from saying no to distractions and focusing on projects that directly supported my main goal'), which is a summarizing punchline. The post as a whole is structured as a list of 'lessons learned,' which is more motivational and summarizing than Shaw's typical stepwise, factual breakdowns. The engagement prompt is at the end and factual, which is on-brand.

Step 3: Weigh red flags. The use of summarizing tricolons, motivational framing ('here’s what I learned'), and the overall 'lessons learned' structure are significant deviations from Shaw's style. While the list is practical, the tone and structure are more in line with generic LinkedIn advice posts than Shaw's educational, context-driven approach.

Step 4: Cross-reference with examples. Shaw's posts about income or milestones (see the $10k month example) are factual, break down the numbers, and avoid summarizing punchlines or tricolons. He does not frame posts as 'here’s what I learned' or use motivational language. The current post is closer to the negative examples in tone and structure.

Step 5: Final check. The cumulative effect of the summarizing tricolons, motivational framing, and 'lessons learned' structure makes this post not sound like Shaw. Even though the list is practical, the overall tone and structure are off-brand."
post-010,False,"Step 1: Summarize Shaw's style from the examples. Shaw's posts are practical, educational, and structured with a hook, a problem/observation, and a solution/resource. He avoids idioms, motivational catchphrases, and business jargon. His posts are factual, use clear examples (often with 'e.g.'), and end with a factual engagement prompt. He does not use summarizing tricolons, punchlines, or generic motivational language.

Step 2: Check for red flags in the post.
- The post opens with a general statement: 'Bank accounts fluctuate. Real wealth is what you know and can do.' This is a summarizing, motivational punchline, not a factual or curiosity-driven hook.
- The next sentence, 'Skills and knowledge compound in ways cash doesn’t. Money can be lost, spent, or devalued, but practical abilities are more durable, transferable, and less likely to disappear if circumstances change.' uses a tricolon with negation ('Money can be lost, spent, or devalued, but practical abilities are more durable...'). This is a persuasive tricolon, which is a red flag.
- The phrase 'Skills and knowledge compound in ways cash doesn’t' is a generic, motivational phrase, not a literal or technical explanation.
- The post continues with 'Every hour spent learning a new tool or building a skill increases your long-term leverage. It’s the most reliable way to build optionality and resilience.' This is again motivational and uses business jargon ('leverage', 'optionality', 'resilience').
- The engagement prompt is at the end and factual, which is on-brand.

Step 3: Weigh red flags against overall structure and value. While the post is about learning and skills (a topic Shaw covers), the tone is motivational, uses summarizing punchlines, tricolons, and business jargon, and lacks a clear, stepwise breakdown or concrete examples. There is no specific problem/observation or actionable solution/resource, just general advice.

Step 4: Cross-reference with examples. Shaw's posts avoid motivational language and business jargon, and always provide concrete value or explanation. This post is more generic and motivational, similar to the negative examples.

Step 5: Final check. The post contains multiple major red flags: motivational tone, summarizing punchline, tricolon with negation, and business jargon. It does not sound like Shaw Talebi."
