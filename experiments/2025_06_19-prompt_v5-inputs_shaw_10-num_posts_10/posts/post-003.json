  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose and Audience\n- Purpose: Encourage readers (especially aspiring AI engineers and solopreneurs) to focus on building real projects rather than feeling held back by perceived intelligence gaps.\n- Audience: Early-career AI engineers, self-taught learners, solopreneurs interested in AI.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n- Hook (above the fold): Tease a misconception about top AI engineers.\n- Body: Clarify that intelligence isn't the main factor—practical building is. Give examples of how frequent building accelerates learning and opportunity. Suggest small, practical projects anyone can start. Bullet actionable steps.\n- CTA: Ask readers to share their next AI project.\n\nStep 3: Body\nMany assume top AI engineers got ahead by being naturally brilliant. What actually sets them apart is their bias for building. They create, test, and ship more than most people around them. \n\nEach shipped project—no matter how small—teaches clarity you won’t get from tutorials or passively consuming research papers.\n\nIf you want to get better quickly:\n- Pick a simple idea\n- Build fast and share your work\n- Iterate based on feedback\n- Move on and repeat\n\nYou do not need a PhD or prior experience to start learning by doing.\n\nStep 4: CTA or Question\nWhat’s the next AI project you’re building?\n\nStep 5: Hook Brainstorming (directions with notes)\n1. [Beginner/Expert Clarity] Most top AI engineers aren’t more intelligent; they just build more.\n2. [Personal observation] Building matters more than intelligence in AI engineering.\n3. [Trend/urgency] In AI, output matters more than titles or degrees.\n4. [Problem/Solution] Stuck comparing yourself to top AI engineers? Focus on project output.\n5. [User’s own phrasing] Most top AI engineers aren’t more intelligent than you. They just do this one thing more… BUILD\n\nStep 5B: Short notes:\n1. [Beginner] Deflate myth of intelligence, push hands-on approach.\n2. [Personal] Reframe success as project frequency.\n3. [Trend] Results over credentials, ship > show.\n4. [Problem] Anxiety about fitting in goes away with more projects.\n5. [User] Direct adaptation of user’s phrase, simple and bold.\n\nStep 5C: Chosen direction\nI’ll use number 1 as it hits the core of Shaw’s style (direct, approachable, pushes building).\nFinal hook: Most top AI engineers aren’t more intelligent—they just build more projects.\n\nStep 6: Draft of Full Post\nMost top AI engineers aren’t more intelligent—they just build more projects.\n\nIt’s easy to assume the gap is raw intelligence. But the real difference comes from a bias for action. Top AI engineers put more time into building and shipping real projects rather than trying to be perfect or waiting to feel ready.\n\nEvery project—no matter how simple—gives you feedback you can’t get from tutorials.\n\nIf you want to improve faster:\n- Pick a small, specific problem\n- Build a quick solution and test it\n- Share what you made\n- Take notes, iterate, and repeat\n\nYou don’t need rare innate talent to do this. You just need to start with something you can finish this week.\n\nWhat’s the next AI project you’re building?\n\nStep 7: Review for Style, Voice, Flow\n- One em dash (ok)\n- Direct, literal language \n- Factual, practical, no business clichés or metaphors\n- Clear structure, breaks for scannability\n- CTA invites a practical response\n- Tone is technical mentor + entrepreneur\n\nStep 8: Final Post",
  "final_post": "Most top AI engineers aren’t more intelligent—they just build more projects.\n\nIt’s easy to assume the difference comes down to raw intelligence, but the key factor is action. Top engineers choose to build and ship more often, instead of getting stuck overthinking or waiting to feel ready.\n\nEvery project—no matter how basic—teaches lessons you cannot get from watching tutorials.\n\nIf you want to improve quickly:\n- Pick a small, clear problem\n- Build a working solution\n- Share your result\n- Take notes, iterate, and repeat\n\nYou don’t need special talent to follow this. You just need to start and finish a project this week.\n\nWhat’s the next AI project you’re building?"
