  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose and Target Audience\n- Purpose: Share practical, hard-earned AI principles for early-career professionals and aspiring engineers to help them avoid common mistakes.\n- Target Audience: Early-career AI engineers, students, and anyone getting started in AI.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n[Hook]\n[5 principles as bullet points + 1-2 lines context for each]\n[CTA: factual, prompting specific technical input]\n\nStep 3: Body (meat)\nLay out each principle as a direct statement, with one explanatory line for each. Stay literal and actionable.\n\nStep 4: CTA\nAsk for one specific principle readers would add (practical and focused).\n\nStep 5: Hooks Brainstorm\nA. [User's phrasing] \"AI principles I know at 29, I wish I had known at 24.\"\nB. [Problem/solution] \"Most new AI engineers focus on the wrong things. Here are 5 lessons I wish I'd started with.\"\nC. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] \"The biggest mistakes I made early in AI (and what to do instead).\"\nD. [Numbered list] \"5 real-world AI principles I wish someone had told me earlier.\"\nE. [Trend/urgency] \"Too many people jump straight into tools—here are the AI principles that actually matter.\"\n\nStep 5B: Notes for each direction\nA. (Captures genuine reflection; close to original)\nB. (Sets up common pitfalls)\nC. (Shows learning-from-failure angle)\nD. (Simple, direct)\nE. (Addresses growing hype and tool-obsession)\n\nStep 5C: Strongest direction\nThe original phrasing is direct and personal, matching Shaw's voice. I'll use direction A, drawing on D for clarity.\n\nFinal Hook: \nAI principles I know at 29, I wish I had known at 24.\n\nStep 6: Full Draft\nAI principles I know at 29, I wish I had known at 24.\n\nIf you're early in your AI career (or even if not), these are the five things I would focus on:\n\n- Don't use AI if you don't need it. Not every problem needs a model or automation.\n- Focus on real problems, not just technology or hype.\n- Spend more time on data curation. The upfront work pays off later.\n- Prioritize data quality over data quantity. More examples won't fix poor labels or noise.\n- Run experiments continuously instead of chasing perfect solutions on paper.\n\nWhat practical principle would you add to this list?\n\nStep 7: Style/Voice/Flow Review\n- Hook is fact-based, personal without being motivational.\n- Each principle is stated plainly, with actionable notes.\n- CTA is single, practical, and literal. No 'or' or motivational prompt.\n- No em dash (checked!).\n- No business clichés or idioms.\n- Cross-referenced with examples 1 and 5—tone, spacing, structure, and intent align closely.\n\nStep 8: Final Post",
