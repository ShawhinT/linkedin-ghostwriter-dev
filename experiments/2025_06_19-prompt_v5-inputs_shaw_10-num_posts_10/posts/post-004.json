  "final_post": "7 LLM use cases that help me avoid hiring as a solopreneur:\n\nWhen I need to fill a gap in my workflow, my first step isn’t posting a job or hiring a freelancer. I use LLMs for these tasks instead:\n\n1. Coding assistant — Troubleshoots, explains, and writes code to speed up development.\n2. Researching new topics — Summarizes technical papers and online docs so I can go from 0 to 1 on something fast.\n3. Writing copy — Crafts headlines, landing pages, and product blurbs for websites or campaigns.\n4. Generating email outreach scripts — Prepares email sequences for cold outreach or networking.\n5. ICP refinement — Helps identify and describe my target customer with key pain points and use cases.\n6. Turning podcasts into blogs — Drafts written articles or summaries from podcast transcripts.\n7. Creating peer groups for courses — Clusters students or users into meaningful groups using bios and answers.\n\nEach one saves hours—sometimes days—of extra work, and makes it easier to operate solo.\n\nWhat would you add to this list?"
