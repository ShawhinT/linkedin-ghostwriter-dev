  "writing_steps": "Step 1:\n- Purpose: Educate and share a resource (free guide) of actionable AI project ideas, illustrating range from basic data analysis to advanced AI engineering.\n- Target audience: Aspiring AI engineers, developers, and entrepreneurs looking for practical project ideas.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n[Hook: Clear, numbers-driven title that signals scope]\n[Body: Brief intro about the diversity of AI project types + short explanation of the 3 categories ('Software 1.0, 2.0, 3.0') + highlight that these projects are practical for a weekend build]\n[CTA: Prompt for reader's favorite category or what they'd add]\n[Link to guide before CTA if available]\n\nStep 3: Body (Meat)\nBuilding AI projects is the fastest way to actually learn the technology.\n\nI created a free guide listing 30 project ideas, broken out by \"generation\":\n\n- Software 1.0: Data analysis, pipelines, classic programming\n- Software 2.0: Projects based on machine learning models\n- Software 3.0: Prompt engineering, RAG apps, AI agents, fine-tuning\n\nEach project can be tackled over a weekend, and all rely on free or open-source tools.\n\nStep 4: CTA or question\nWhat’s your pick: 1.0, 2.0, or 3.0?\n\nStep 5: Hook (brainstorm directions)\n1. [List/number angle] \"30 AI Projects You Can Build This Weekend\"\n2. [Problem/solution] \"Not sure where to start with AI?\"\n3. [Learning angle] \"Building is the fastest way to learn AI.\"\n4. [Range/variety] \"From data pipelines to AI agents—all in one guide.\"\n5. [User’s phrasing] The exact headline from the input\n\nNotes for each:\n1. 30 projects is a big draw; the headline is very direct.\n2. This angle speaks to beginners feeling stuck; relevant for engagement.\n3. Focuses more on why building matters, but less on the guide itself.\n4. Emphasizes spectrum of AI apps covered; could use as supporting body.\n5. The user's phrase is on point—very direct and clear.\n\nStep 6: Write a draft of the full post\n30 AI Projects You Can Build This Weekend (Free Guide)\n\nBuilding AI projects is the fastest way to learn. My new free guide shares 30 projects you can build—categorized by software generation:\n\n- Software 1.0: Data analysis, pipelines\n- Software 2.0: ML-powered apps\n- Software 3.0: Prompt engineering, RAG, AI agents, fine-tuning\n\nEach project is scoped for a weekend and uses free or open-source tools—so you can start right away.\n\n[Link]\n\nWhat’s your pick: 1.0, 2.0, or 3.0?\n\nStep 7: Review for style, voice, and flow\n- No business clichés, idioms, or metaphors\n- At most one em dash, and it’s for clarity (“so you can start right away.”)\n- Clear, factual, practical\n- No assumptions on Shaw's personal experience\n- Focused on offering technical value and a clear resource\n\nStep 8: Final post below.",
