post-004,True,"Step 1: Summarize Shaw's style. Shaw's posts are factual, practical, and educational, often using clear lists or frameworks. He uses a hook-problem-solution structure, provides context or explanation, and ends with a factual engagement prompt. He avoids idioms, business jargon, motivational punchlines, and generic life lessons. Playful or light humor is rare but possible. 

Step 2: Check for red flags. 
- The post uses a factual, numerical breakdown of the past year, which is consistent with Shaw's style. 
- The bullet points are clear, literal, and practical, with no idioms, business jargon, or motivational catchphrases. 
- The phrase ""learning fastest by building in public"" is slightly more conversational, but not an idiom or cliché. 
- The closing sentence, ""Measuring progress this way gives me more insight than any single win or loss,"" is a mild summarizing statement, but not a motivational punchline or tricolon. It is factual and fits the context of the post. 
- The engagement prompt at the end is factual and in the correct position.

Step 2a: Special considerations. 
- There are no generic motivational phrases, no idioms, and the examples are formatted as a list, which is typical for Shaw. 
- The closing is a factual engagement prompt, not a motivational punchline. 
- There are no cumulative minor deviations.

Step 3: Weigh red flags. There are no significant red flags. The post is practical, educational, and follows Shaw's structure.

Step 4: Cross-reference with examples. Shaw has shared similar posts breaking down numbers and lessons learned, using a similar structure and tone.

Step 5: The post provides clear value, context, and follows the hook-problem-solution structure. It is consistent with Shaw's style."
post-008,True,"Step 1: Summarize Shaw's style from the examples. Shaw's posts are practical, educational, and structured, often using stepwise lists. He avoids idioms, business clichés, and motivational catchphrases. His openers are factual or curiosity-driven, sometimes lightly playful. He provides context for why something matters and ends with a factual engagement prompt.

Step 2: Check for red flags. The post starts with a tricolon opener: 'Being technical is just the start—here are 15 skills I had to learn (the hard way) as a data entrepreneur.' The use of 'the hard way' is mildly conversational but not a cliché. The list is stepwise and practical, with each item clearly explained. There are a few parenthetical asides (e.g., 'especially if you’re not a natural', 'it doesn’t need to look great—just work', 'most people won’t reply, and that’s expected'), which are factual and explanatory, not motivational. There is one em-dash in the opener and one in point 7, which is within the acceptable limit. The phrase 'ship anyway' in point 11 is slightly informal but not a business cliché or idiom. There are no idioms, business jargon, or motivational punchlines. The engagement prompt at the end is factual and on-brand.

Step 3: Weigh red flags against overall structure. The post is highly practical, educational, and follows Shaw's typical structure: hook (opener), problem/observation (skills needed beyond technical ability), solution/resource (the list), and a factual engagement prompt. There are no major or cumulative minor deviations.

Step 4: Cross-reference with examples. Shaw often uses numbered lists, clear explanations, and factual engagement prompts. The tone and structure of this post are consistent with his style.

Step 5: Final check. The post provides clear value, follows the hook-problem-solution structure, and avoids idioms, clichés, and motivational language. There are no significant deviations from Shaw's style."
post-009,True,"Step 1: Summarize Shaw's style. Shaw's posts are practical, educational, and structured, often using clear lists or frameworks. He avoids idioms, business jargon, and motivational punchlines, and typically ends with a factual engagement prompt. His example formatting uses 'e.g.' and his tone is factual, not overtly persuasive or emotional.

Step 2: Check for red flags. This post uses a numbered list with concrete, realistic examples and specific numbers, which is consistent with Shaw's style. The language is clear and literal, with no idioms, business clichés, or motivational catchphrases. The example formatting is standard (not 'think:' or informal). The closing sentence is a factual engagement prompt ('What would you add to this list?'), which matches Shaw's typical structure. There is one em-dash, but it is used in a factual, not motivational, context. There are no tricolons, asyndetic parallelism, or salesy language. The post does not skip the 'why it matters' step, as the opening and closing sentences frame the value of the list.

Step 3: Weigh red flags against overall structure. There are no significant red flags. The post is practical, educational, and follows Shaw's typical structure.

Step 4: Cross-reference with examples. The post is very similar to Shaw's positive examples, especially those that use lists to break down practical ways to earn or learn (e.g., '25 AI Buzzwords Explained for Entrepreneurs').

Step 5: Final check. The post provides clear value, follows the hook-problem-solution structure, and ends with a factual engagement prompt. There are no cumulative minor deviations that would change the overall feel or clarity of the post. It is highly consistent with Shaw's style."
post-005,True,"Step 1: Summarize Shaw's style. Shaw's posts are practical, educational, and structured with a hook, problem/observation, and solution/resource. He avoids idioms, motivational catchphrases, and business jargon. He uses clear, stepwise lists, and his engagement prompts are factual and at the end. He may use a light, original metaphor or a single emoji, but avoids generic motivational tones or summarizing punchlines.

Step 2: Check for red flags. This post opens with a milestone announcement, which Shaw sometimes does, and expresses gratitude, which is not off-brand. The main lesson is stated factually: making complex topics clear and actionable is more important than chasing numbers. The post then provides a stepwise list of three practical tips, each explained clearly and concretely. There are no idioms, business clichés, or motivational catchphrases. The closing sentence is a factual engagement prompt. There is a single, mild summarizing sentence before the prompt (""Communication is a skill you build by teaching, getting things wrong, and constantly refining how you share what you know.""), but it is not a tricolon or overtly motivational punchline.

Step 3: Weigh red flags against overall structure. The post follows Shaw's typical structure: hook (milestone), observation (what matters most is clarity/actionability), solution (three practical tips), and a factual engagement prompt. The language is clear and literal, and the value is explained. The minor summarizing sentence is not a strong deviation.

Step 4: Cross-reference with examples. Shaw has shared milestone posts and practical lists before. The tone, structure, and educational value are consistent with his style. The engagement prompt is at the end and factual.

Step 5: Final check. There are no idioms, business jargon, or motivational punchlines. The post is practical, educational, and follows Shaw's structure. There are no cumulative minor deviations that change the overall feel or clarity of the post."
post-002,False,"Step 1: Summarize Shaw's style. Shaw's posts are factual, practical, and educational, often using clear lists or frameworks. He uses a hook-problem-solution structure, avoids idioms, motivational catchphrases, and business jargon, and ends with a factual engagement prompt. He may use a single emoji or playful metaphor, but rarely. He does not use summarizing tricolons or punchlines, and his posts do not have a generic motivational tone.

Step 2: Identify red flags. This post contains several red flags:
- The phrase ""The biggest lesson? Stack multiple income streams."" is a summarizing punchline and motivational in tone, which is not characteristic of Shaw's style. Shaw typically avoids summarizing tricolons or punchlines and lets the list stand on its own.
- The phrase ""the progress compounds—slowly"" is a motivational, summarizing statement, and uses an em-dash for emphasis, which is not typical for Shaw (who rarely uses em-dashes, and not in punchlines).
- The post uses ""Lots of pivots, experiments, and learning—most of which didn’t work out."" which is a tricolon with a negation, another red flag.
- The overall tone is more reflective and motivational than Shaw's usual factual, practical, and educational style.

Step 3: Weigh red flags against overall structure. While the post does provide a factual breakdown of income streams (which is on-brand), the presence of multiple summarizing, motivational statements and tricolons with negation shifts the tone away from Shaw's typical style. The engagement prompt at the end is factual, but the preceding motivational summary is not characteristic.

Step 4: Cross-reference with examples. Shaw's actual post on this topic is more factual and avoids summarizing punchlines. He shares the income breakdown and context, but does not summarize with a motivational lesson or use tricolons with negation. The negative examples in the guidelines also flag similar issues.

Step 5: Final check. There are more than two minor deviations (summarizing punchline, motivational tone, tricolon with negation, em-dash in punchline), which collectively change the overall feel of the post. Therefore, it does not sound like Shaw."
post-003,True,"Step 1: Summarize Shaw's style. Shaw's posts are practical, educational, and structured with a clear hook, problem/observation, and solution/resource. He uses clear, literal language, stepwise lists, and factual engagement prompts. He avoids idioms, business jargon, motivational punchlines, and generic phrasing. Resource announcements typically include a stepwise breakdown or clear explanation of what the resource covers.

Step 2: Check for red flags. This post:
- Opens with a factual, curiosity-driven statement (""Deploying your ML model shouldn’t be a mystery."")
- Provides a clear, stepwise breakdown of what the guide covers, using literal language (""Build a FastAPI app..."", ""Dockerize your application..."", etc.)
- No idioms, business clichés, or motivational catchphrases are present.
- The engagement prompt is factual and at the end (""What tools or frameworks are you using to deploy ML projects?"")
- The explanation of the resource is clear and practical, mentioning sample code, configuration tips, and solutions to common pitfalls.
- No informal example formatting (e.g., ""think:"") or summarizing tricolons.
- No excessive em-dashes (one is used, but in a factual context).

Step 3: Weigh red flags against overall structure. There are no significant red flags. The post is practical, educational, and follows Shaw's typical structure.

Step 4: Cross-reference with examples. This post is highly consistent with Shaw's positive examples, especially those announcing resources or guides with stepwise breakdowns and clear engagement prompts.

Step 5: Final check. The post provides clear value, follows the hook-problem-solution structure, and avoids all major and minor red flags. It sounds like Shaw's style."
post-001,True,"Step 1: Summarize Shaw's style. Shaw's posts are factual, practical, and educational, often using clear lists or frameworks. He uses a hook-problem-solution structure, avoids idioms, business jargon, and motivational punchlines, and ends with a factual engagement prompt. Playful metaphors are rare and original, not generic. Resource announcements include a clear breakdown of what's inside.

Step 2: Check for red flags. The post uses a numbered list to break down the setup, which is on-brand. The language is clear and literal (e.g., 'The backbone of almost every AI project I work on').

The post ends with a factual engagement prompt ('What tool would you add to your development stack?'). The resource announcement ('I break down each tool and my workflow in a new video') is clear and provides context. There is no business jargon, motivational language, or summarizing tricolon.
