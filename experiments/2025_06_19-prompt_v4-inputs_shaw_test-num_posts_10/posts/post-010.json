  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Share a practical, transparent breakdown of an AI-driven content creation strategy that generated $15,000, illustrating the approach and learnings in a way that educates and inspires credible action. \n- Target audience: Fellow entrepreneurs, creators, and AI/tech freelancers interested in building income streams with AI tools and content.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n[Hook]\n[Strategy summary: transparent steps, breakdowns, and practical tools/processes]\n[CTA: focused, technical or practical—e.g., “What would you add?” or “What works for your workflow?”]\n\nStep 3: Write the meat\n- Context: Framing the $15k milestone with AI-driven content creation. What was done, how, and what tools/methods/process were used.\n- Breakdown: Outline the actual strategy as a high-level checklist with actionable steps (e.g., selecting niche, batching process, AI tool stack, distribution plan, monetization path).\n- Lessons: Key technical or workflow insights (e.g., batch production, prompt engineering, content repurposing, distribution automation, or pitfalls).\n\nStep 4: CTA\n- Ask for practical additions to the process or invite readers to share the one step they’d focus on first.\n\nStep 5: Hook Development\nStep 5A: Brainstorm hook angles\n1. [Results/Outcomes]: Directly lead with the $15k milestone.\n2. [Numbers/Clarity]: \"How to go from $0 to $15k with AI content – my actual workflow.\"\n3. [Process Transparency]: \"What actually goes into a $15,000 AI content system.\"\n4. [Pain-point]: \"Most creators spin wheels with content. Here’s my step-by-step process to $15,000 using AI tools.\"\n\nStep 5B: Add notes to each direction:\n1. [Results/Outcomes]: Clear, quantifiable—draws interest from creators seeking similar results.\n2. [Numbers/Clarity]: Sets up an actionable walkthrough.\n3. [Process Transparency]: Leans into Shaw’s transparent, stepwise style.\n4. [Pain-point]: Confronts the confusion/frustration many face when starting out.\n\nStep 5C: Choose final hook: Go with [Results/Outcomes], phrased literally for clarity and immediate intrigue.\n\nFinal Hook: \"Here’s how I used AI to generate $15,000 with content in under a year.\"\n\nStep 6: Draft full post\n---\nHere’s how I used AI to generate $15,000 with content in under a year.\n\nThe biggest factor: a system that let me consistently publish useful material without burning out.\n\nMy process, step-by-step:\n\n1. Picked a niche where I already had expertise.\n2. Outlined content topics upfront, so I never wondered “What should I post?”\n3. Used GPT-4 for fast first drafts and brainstorming, saving hours every week.\n4. Batched video and written content in focused sessions, then tweaked with human edits for clarity.\n5. Scheduled and distributed posts with automation (Buffer and Zapier are my main stack).\n6. Turned high-performing content into lead magnets and mini-products (PDF guides, short video courses).\n7. Tracked channels and revenue closely to double down on what was actually working.\n\nThe result: $15,000 in sales from a mix of digital products and consulting—driven almost entirely by AI-supported content.\n\nWhat would you add to your own AI content workflow?\n\n---\n\nStep 7: Review for Style, Voice, and Flow\n- Audit for em dashes (not overused/gone)\n- No repeated phrases\n- Literal, direct language\n- No business clichés, idioms, or motivational punchlines\n- Matches Example 1 and 2 for structure and transparency\n\nStep 8: Final Post\n\n[Ready for posting below]",
  "final_post": "Here’s how I used AI to generate $15,000 with content in under a year.\n\nThe key was building a system so I could publish consistently without burning out.\n\nHere’s a practical breakdown of the whole process:\n\n1. Chose a niche I already had credibility in.\n2. Outlined content topics ahead of time to remove guesswork.\n3. Used GPT-4 for first drafts and brainstorming—huge time-saver.\n4. Batched video/written content, then edited for clarity.\n5. Automated scheduling and distribution with Buffer and Zapier.\n6. Turned proven posts into lead magnets and digital products (like PDF guides and video courses).\n7. Tracked performance and revenue by channel, so I could focus on what worked.\n\nThis process led to $15,000 in revenue from digital products and consulting—almost all driven by AI-supported content.\n\nWhat’s one step you’d add to your own AI content workflow?"
