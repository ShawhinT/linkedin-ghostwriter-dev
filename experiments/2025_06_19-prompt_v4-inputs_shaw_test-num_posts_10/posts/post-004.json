  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Share a transparent recap of the past year by the numbers to educate and invite engagement, using Shaw’s signature behind-the-scenes style.\n- Audience: Fellow entrepreneurs and creators, AI learners, Shaw’s LinkedIn network (broad but slightly more entrepreneurial/tech-focused). \n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n- Hook: Factual, curiosity-driven line about a year in numbers.\n- Body: List of quantifiable milestones or stats from the past year, with brief, practical context for each.\n- CTA: Invite audience to share a number or stat they are most curious about for their own journey.\n\nStep 3: Body (Meat)\n- Number of projects shipped\n- Newsletter subscriber count\n- Content output (number of posts, videos, or newsletters)\n- New skills acquired (courses taken, tech stacks learned)\n- Unexpected metric (failures, pivots, experiments that didn’t work)\n- Optional: Line on how measuring these helps clarify progress\n\nStep 4: CTA or Question\nWhat metric or number matters most to you in your own journey?\n\nStep 5: Hook Directions\n5A. Brainstorm directions:\n- [Year-in-numbers/curiosity] \"My past year—broken down by the numbers\"\n- [Transparency/behind-the-scenes] \"The real stats from my year as an AI educator and entrepreneur\"\n- [Results/quantitative reflection] \"What actually changed for me this year: the numbers, not the stories\"\n- [User’s own phrasing] \"Birthday post. Past year recap by the numbers.\"\n\n5B. Build out key notes:\n- [Year-in-numbers/curiosity] “People love number posts, makes it concrete—replay key stats that show real progress, not just wins”\n- [Transparency/behind-the-scenes] “Honest about wins and misses, numbers only (no hype)”\n- [Results] “Clear before/after or visible changes; what matters is the transparency”\n- [User’s phrasing] “Simple and direct—matches Shaw’s usual tone”\n\n5C. Choose strongest angle: Go with “My past year—broken down by the numbers” for its clarity and curiosity for unfamiliar readers.\n\nStep 6: Draft of Full Post\n\nMy past year—broken down by the numbers\n\n- 3 new AI projects shipped (learned fast by building in public)\n- 48 LinkedIn posts written (steady pace—even on weeks with zero motivation)\n- 1,200 new newsletter subscribers (biggest channel for staying connected)\n- 2 tech stacks learned (including my first real front-end app)\n- 4 ideas that flopped (reminder: not every experiment works, but each one teaches me something)\n\nMeasuring these gives me a clearer sense of progress than any single win or loss.\n\nWhat metric or number matters most to you in your own journey?\n\nStep 7: Review for Style, Voice, and Flow\n- Factual, literal, and educational tone\n- Transparent about both progress and failures\n- No hype, no motivational language, and only one clear CTA\n- Follows the example post style (see Example Posts 2 & 3)\n- No use of business clichés or idioms\n- Scannable list format, direct prose\n\nStep 8: Final Post\n",
  "final_post": "My past year—broken down by the numbers\n\n- 3 new AI projects shipped (learning fastest by building in public)\n- 48 LinkedIn posts published (sticking with a steady pace)\n- 1,200 new newsletter subscribers (main way I stay connected to this community)\n- 2 tech stacks learned (first time deploying a front-end app)\n- 4 experiments that missed the mark (each one taught me something practical)\n\nMeasuring progress this way gives me more insight than any single win or loss.\n\nWhat metric or number matters most to you in your own journey?"
