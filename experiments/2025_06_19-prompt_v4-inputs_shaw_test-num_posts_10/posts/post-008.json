  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose and Audience\n- Purpose: Educate by outlining a realistic skills checklist for anyone trying to become a data entrepreneur; validate content idea by sharing a 'things people rarely mention' perspective.\n- Target Audience: Aspiring data entrepreneurs, technical folks considering freelancing or solopreneur paths, and those learning what goes into building an independent business in data/AI.\n\nStep 2: Post Wireframe\n[Hook: Clear statement or question about the many hidden skills entrepreneurs must build]\n[Body: List of 15 practical skills, split or grouped for readability, each with a 1-line explanation if possible]\n[CTA: What would you add to this list?]\n\nStep 3: Write the body\nHere are 15 skills I didn't realize I'd need when I started out trying to build a data/AI business:\n\n1. Spotting real pain points (not just interesting use cases)\n2. Basic coding (enough to build and automate small projects)\n3. Effective use of AI tools (for research, automation, prototyping)\n4. Sales skills (especially if you're not a natural)\n5. Talking with clients (translate tech jargon to their language)\n6. Writing clearly (for everything: pitches, docs, blogs)\n7. Building simple websites (doesn't need to be pretty—just needs to exist)\n8. Creating content (to build trust and get noticed)\n9. Doing cold outreach (DMs, emails—most people don't reply but that's normal)\n10. Posting regularly (even when it feels pointless)\n11. Looking foolish (most experiments fail—ship anyway)\n12. Continuous learning (keep up with tech and business skills)\n13. Negotiating pricing (value yourself, not just your deliverables)\n14. Managing projects (deadlines, scope creep, communication)\n15. Setting boundaries (otherwise work expands forever)\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhat skills did you have to pick up when switching to entrepreneurship?\n\nStep 5A: Brainstorm Hook Directions\n- [List/Checklist Teaser] \"15 things you need to learn to go from data scientist to entrepreneur\"\n- [Beginner-to-Expert Reality Check] \"Being technical is only the start—here are the other 14 skills I had to pick up as a (data) entrepreneur\"\n- [Problem/Solution] \"Everyone talks about building AI products, but no one tells you about these 15 nontechnical skills you actually need\"\n- [Personal Story] \"My biggest surprise when I became a data entrepreneur? The coding part was the easiest. Here are the rest.\"\n- [User’s own phrasing] \"15 things I had to learn to become a (data) entrepreneur\"\n\nStep 5B: Short notes for each\n- [List/Checklist Teaser] Clear, graphic; tells reader exactly what they'll get.\n- [Beginner-to-Expert] Highlights the gap for techies moving into business.\n- [Problem/Solution] Addresses overlooked skills—good for surprising readers.\n- [Personal Story] Makes it honest, highlights unexpected lessons.\n- [User’s own phrasing] Straightforward; works if reader expects a checklist.\n\nStep 5C: Pick strongest direction and write hook\nThe \"Beginner-to-Expert Reality Check\" is strongest, as it speaks to technical readers who will see themselves in it.\n\nFinal Hook: \"Being technical is just the start—here are 15 skills I had to learn (the hard way) as a data entrepreneur.\"\n\nStep 6: Draft the Full Post\nBeing technical is just the start—here are 15 skills I had to learn (the hard way) as a data entrepreneur.\n\n1. Spotting real pain points (not just interesting use cases)\n2. Basic coding (enough to build and automate small projects)\n3. Effective use of AI tools (for research, automation, prototyping)\n4.

Setting boundaries (otherwise work expands forever)\n\nWhat skills would you add to this list?\n\nStep 7: Style, Voice, and Flow Audit\n- Checklist/bullet format for scannability\n- White space for easy reading\n- Each bullet is factual, direct, and literal\n- No motivational or reflective language\n- CTA is focused and practical\n- Hook is curiosity-inducing and matches the post’s intent\n\nStep 8: Final Post",
