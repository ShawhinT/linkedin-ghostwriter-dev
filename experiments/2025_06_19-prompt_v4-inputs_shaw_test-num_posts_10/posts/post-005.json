  "writing_steps": "**Step 1: Purpose & Audience**\n- Purpose: Mark the milestone of 60k YouTube subs. Use it as a springboard to talk about why learning and communication motivate Shaw to create content. Share actionable, practical lessons for other educators and creators about what matters most—educating clearly, not just chasing numbers.\n- Audience: Aspiring/active YouTube educators, solopreneurs, people interested in learning + teaching online, and Shaw’s existing audience.\n\n**Step 2: Wireframe**\n- Hook: Factual milestone or curiosity-driven statement.\n- Meat: Reflect honestly on hitting 60k. What has mattered more than the number? (Learning, communication.) Practical tips or frameworks about educating on YouTube—clarity, teaching mindset, communication skills, etc. Be direct, simple, and focused on what’s helped Shaw (avoid motivational takeaways).\n- CTA: Specific and practical. E.g., “What’s the hardest part about explaining complex ideas on YouTube?” or “What would you add to this list for clear communication?”\n\n**Step 3: Body**\n- Acknowledge hitting 60k subscribers and thank viewers for their support.\n- Share how the actual ‘win’ isn’t the number, but what Shaw’s learned about teaching and communicating ideas clearly to help others.\n- Share a practical 2-3 point list of what’s consistently improved learning/communication impact since starting on YouTube (e.g., breaking down complex ideas visually, using analogies, focusing on real examples, etc.).\n- Emphasize actual changes made to communication style as a result of feedback/learning.\n\n**Step 4: CTA**\n- Focus on one actionable question for educators/creators: “What’s your go-to technique for making complex topics clear on video?”\n\n**Step 5: Hook Directions**\nA) [Milestone/stat] “60k subscribers on YouTube (and one thing I wish I’d known sooner)”\nB) [User’s language] “Why I started YouTube wasn’t subs—it was learning and communication”\nC) [Problem/solution] “Explaining complex ideas online: what I’ve learned after 60k subs”\nD) [Behind the scenes] “60k subs later, here’s how teaching on YouTube changed how I learn”\nE) [Beginner → expert clarity] “Most people think you need fancy gear or editing for YouTube. But the only thing that actually matters for educators:...”\n\n**Notes for hook:**\n- (A) is strongest: cites milestone and promises a practical lesson.\n- (C) or (D) focus the topic on teaching/communication, rather than just growth.\n- Final hook: Use (A), but tie it to ‘what I wish I’d focused on from the start.’\n\n**Step 6: Draft**\n---\n\n60k subscribers on YouTube (and what I wish I’d focused on from day one)\n\nHitting 60k subs is a big milestone, and I’m grateful to everyone who’s watched or commented on my videos. \n\nBut the most important thing I’ve learned along the way: The real impact comes from making complex topics clear and actionable—not just chasing numbers or views.\n\nHere are the 3 things I keep coming back to as an educator on YouTube:\n\n1. Use examples, not just theory. Abstract ideas land better when tied to real problems, projects, or stories.\n2. Visuals matter. Diagrams and simple screen shares are more useful for learning than fancy graphics or edits.\n3. Feedback loops. Responding to questions and confusion in the comments helps me improve how I explain ideas next time.\n\nCommunication is a skill you build by teaching, getting things wrong, and constantly refining how you share what you know.\n\nWhat’s your go-to technique for making complex topics clear on video?\n\n---\n\n**Step 7: Style, Voice, Flow Review**\n- Clear, honest milestone acknowledgment.\n- No motivational language or summarizing punchline.\n- Each bullet is practical, literal, and grounded in teaching, not content growth.\n- CTA is concrete and addresses the educator/creator audience directly.\n- White space and scannability maintained throughout.\n- No business clichés or idioms present.\n\n**Step 8: Final Post**",
