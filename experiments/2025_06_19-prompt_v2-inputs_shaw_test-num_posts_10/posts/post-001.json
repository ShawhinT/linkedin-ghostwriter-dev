  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Share useful resources/tools for AI development (with a video), potentially educate beginners or those curious about Shaw's process.\n- Audience: Aspiring AI developers, curious learners, anyone who wants to set up their own AI dev environment from scratch.\n\nStep 2: Post Wireframe\n[Hook]\nI rebuilt my AI development environment from scratch—here’s what I installed (and why).\n\n[Meat]\n- Xcode: foundational tools for Mac dev\n- Homebrew: makes installing packages a breeze\n- Python: the language behind most AI workflows\n- GitHub CLI: streamline your repo workflow from the terminal\n- Cursor: my go-to AI-powered IDE\n\n[Video link to demo/setup walk-through]\n\n[CTA]\nWhat’s one tool you can’t live without in your AI dev stack?\n\nStep 3: Body\nEvery time I set up a new machine, I always install the same 5 tools:\n\n1. Xcode – the toolkit for building and compiling on Mac\n2. Homebrew – package management made simple\n3. Python – the backbone of almost every AI project I’ve built\n4. GitHub CLI – work with your repos without leaving the terminal\n5. Cursor – my favorite AI-powered code editor\n\nI made a quick video walking through my setup for anyone starting out (or just curious about my stack):\n[video link]\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhat’s one tool you can’t live without in your AI dev stack?\n\nStep 5A: Hook Brainstorming Directions\n- [User’s phrasing] \"My AI development setup from scratch.\"\n- [Problem/solution] Many get stuck configuring their first dev environment—here's my no-nonsense toolkit.\n- [Beginner-friendly] Starting from zero? These are the 5 tools every AI developer should install first.\n- [Personal workflow] Every new machine, same 5 essentials. Here’s my AI dev stack in 5 minutes.\n- [Tease video/demo] Watch me set up my environment in real time (and steal my setup).\n\nStep 5B: Direction notes\n- [User’s phrasing] Straightforward but may lack urgency.\n- [Problem/solution] Emphasizes ease/confidence for those starting out.\n- [Beginner-friendly] Direct and inclusive for new folks.\n- [Personal workflow] Shaw’s voice. Relatable, habits over hype.\n- [Tease video] Good if the content is really video-focused.\n\nStep 5C: Pick strongest direction: [Personal workflow]. Final hook:\nI rebuilt my AI development environment from scratch—here’s what I installed (and why).\n\nStep 6: Draft Full Post\nI rebuilt my AI development environment from scratch—here’s what I installed (and why).\n\nEvery time I set up a new machine for AI work, I follow the same playbook:\n\n1. Xcode – foundational tools for building & compiling on Mac\n2. Homebrew – makes installing everything else a breeze\n3. Python – still the backbone of most AI workflows\n4. GitHub CLI – keeps my repo workflow terminal-native\n5. Cursor – my AI-powered IDE of choice\n\nI recorded a quick video walking through my setup for those curious (or if you’re looking to refresh your stack):\n[video link]\n\nWhat’s one tool you can’t live without in your AI dev stack?\n\nStep 7: Style, Voice, Flow Review\n- Only one em dash (in hook, justified to create impact)\n- No repeated numbers, hooks, or first lines\n- Language is informal but expert, bullet points used, inviting question\n- Doesn't reference personal experience beyond what the user input gives\n\nStep 8: Final Post",
