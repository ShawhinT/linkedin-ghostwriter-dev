  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose and Audience\n- Purpose: Educate/inspire; share Shaw’s personal journey and concrete skills/mindsets needed for (data) entrepreneurship.\n- Audience: Aspiring data entrepreneurs, technical people exploring entrepreneurship, early-stage founders.\n\nStep 2: Post Wireframe\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Body: List of skills/mindsets with brief commentary]\n\n[CTA/question: Invite the reader to add to the list or share which skill they found hardest to learn]\n\nStep 3: Meat\n- List each of the 15 things, possibly combining for brevity.\n- Share a few lines of context or honest reflection (e.g., which were most unexpected, humbling, or useful).\n\nStep 4: CTA\n- Which of these do you find hardest? \n\nStep 5: Hook - Exploration\nA. [Results/list]: “15 things I had to learn to become a data entrepreneur”\nB. [Painful truth]: “Being great at data isn’t enough to become a successful entrepreneur.”\nC. [Personal story]: “I thought knowing Python was all I needed. I was wrong.”\nD. [Problem/solution]: “Most technical founders start with code and are blindsided by everything else.”\nE. [Beginner-to-expert]: “Everyone focuses on AI tools – but here’s what actually matters.”\n\nStep 5B: Short notes for each direction\n- A: Share the list, straight-up. Clear, encourages scanning.\n- B: Call out the expectation vs. messy reality.\n- C: Start with an “aha” moment or surprise.\n- D: Address common misconception, then deliver the truth.\n- E: Call out a trendy focus, redirect to fundamentals.\n\nStep 5C: Choose strongest direction\n- The “list/results” (A) is strong because it tees up a high-value post. The personal story opener (C) would work, but less directly references the list. Go with A: direct and social-friendly.\n\nStep 6: Draft of Full Post\n\n15 things I had to learn to become a (data) entrepreneur\n\nNobody tells you this, but being a data person is only the start. Here’s what I actually had to learn to get anywhere:\n\n1. Identifying real pain points (not just cool problems)\n2. Coding that solves business needs\n3. How to actually use AI tools – fast\n4. Selling (even if you hate it)\n5. Talking to clients (and really listening)\n6. Writing clearly (emails, docs, content)\n7. Making a website (even a scrappy one)\n8. Posting content (even if nobody reads it)\n9. Doing cold outbound\n10. Just hitting “post,” over and over\n11. Looking foolish, regularly\n12. Constantly learning (markets AND tech)\n\nMost of these felt awkward at first—especially sales and content. But, every step got easier with repetition.\n\nWhich of these do you find hardest?\n\nStep 7: Style, Voice, Flow Review\n- Tone: Honest, approachable, mentor-like\n- Scan for duplicate/awkward phrases, keep flow natural, use white space\n- No more than one em dash (keep only if adds clarity)\n\nStep 8: Final Post",
