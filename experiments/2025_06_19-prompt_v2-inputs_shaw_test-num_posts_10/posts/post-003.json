  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Share new blog post and drive traffic/education\n- Target audience: AI engineers, ML practitioners, technical founders interested in deploying ML solutions; Shaw’s network who want actionable, technical resources\n\nStep 2: Post Wireframe\n\n[Engaging 1-2 line hook]\n[Quick why it matters and what’s covered]\n[Link to blog]\n[Focused CTA/question]\n\nStep 3: Write the body (“meat”)\nShipping an ML model is often harder than training it. Once you have the model, getting it into the hands of users (or your product) reliably is the next challenge. \n\nThat’s why I put together a step-by-step guide on deploying ML solutions using three of my favorite tools:\n\n- FastAPI (for a lightweight web API)\n- Docker (for consistent and portable environments)\n- Google Cloud Platform (for scalable production deployments)\n\nWhether you’re going from notebook to production or just curious about modern best practices, this blog is for you.\n\n\nStep 4: CTA/question\nWhat deployment challenge is tripping you up right now?\n\nStep 5: Brainstorm Hook Directions\nA. [Problem-focused]: \"Building the model is just step one. Deployment? That's where most people get stuck.\"\nB. [Resource-focused]: \"A step-by-step walkthrough for deploying ML models with industry tools (includes my code!)\"\nC. [Modern stack/”next-level” angle]: \"Take your ML app from notebook to production with FastAPI, Docker, and GCP.\"\nD. [Beginner-to-expert clarity]: \"Deploying ML models doesn’t have to be a black box. Here’s how I do it.\"\nE. [User’s own phrasing]: “How to Deploy ML Solutions with FastAPI, Docker, and GCP”\n\nStep 5B: Add notes to hooks\nA. Emphasizes challenge and solution\nB. Promotional/teaser for free resource\nC. Directly lists the stack/tools\nD. De-mystifies the process\nE. Clear reference to user phrasing\n\nStep 5C: Choose/Write Final Hook\nWill use A as it addresses a common pain felt by the audience and quickly sets the context.\n\nStep 6: Full Draft Post\nBuilding the model is just step one. Deployment? That's where most people get stuck.\n\nGetting an ML solution into production—reliably—can be the difference between a cool demo and something your users/clients actually benefit from.\n\nTo make this process clearer, I wrote a step-by-step guide on deploying ML models using:\n- FastAPI (for a production-ready web API)\n- Docker (for consistency + portability)\n- Google Cloud Platform (for scalable deployment)\n\nHere’s the full blog (with code): [link]\n\nWhat deployment challenge is tripping you up right now?\n\nStep 7: Review & Adjust\n- Only one em dash, justified use (“reliably—can be”)\n- No repeated phrasing in hook or first lines\n- Language is direct, technical, friendly\n- No fabricated experience\n- Scannability maintained with bullets\n- Only one clear CTA question\n\nStep 8: Final Post",
