  "writing_steps": "Step 1: \n- Purpose: Celebrate a personal milestone (60k YouTube subscribers) and reflect on its meaning, specifically learning and communication.\n- Target audience: Fellow creators, aspiring YouTubers, and learning-oriented professionals in AI/tech spaces.\n\nStep 2: Post wireframe:\n- [Hook about milestone, tie-in to why it matters]\n- [Reflection on journey: why Shaw started, what 60k means]\n- [Highlight: learning and communication as motivations/principles]\n- [Invitation: focused question for audience]\n\nStep 3 (Body):\n- Hitting 60k isn’t just about a number—it’s about the chance to help more people learn and communicate ideas more clearly. When I started, I saw YouTube as a way to document what I was figuring out and explain it in plain language, hoping even just a few people would find it helpful. The best part of this journey has been seeing how much I’ve learned (and re-learned) in the process, and how my ability to communicate technical ideas has grown with each video.\n\nStep 4 (CTA):\n- What’s the biggest lesson you’ve learned from sharing what you know online?\n\nStep 5A (Hook directions brainstorm):\n1. [Milestone celebration] “Just hit 60,000 subs on YouTube!”\n2. [Learning/teaching theme] “Teaching is the best way to learn—60,000 times over.”\n3. [Audience impact] “60,000 people have joined me on the journey to clearer ideas.”\n4. [Transparency/behind the scenes] “When I started on YouTube, I had no idea what I was doing… now, 60,000 people later…”\n5. [User phrasing] “Milestone post: hitting 60k subs on YouTube. Why: learning and communication.”\n\nStep 5B (Notes):\n1. Number-first, specific milestone.\n2. Focus on the ‘why’ (learning by teaching).\n3. Center audience and relationship.\n4. Personal journey from novice to now.\n5. Direct, clear, root in original user input.\n\nStep 5C (Choose direction and write final hook): \n- “Teaching is the best way to learn—here’s what 60,000 subs has taught me.”\n\nStep 6 (Full draft):\nTeaching is the best way to learn—here’s what 60,000 subs has taught me.\n\nThis milestone isn’t just a number. It’s a reminder of why I started: to get better at learning and communicating technical ideas.\n\nEvery video I make challenges me to simplify, clarify, and reach just a little further. The coolest part? I learn something new every single time—often from the questions and comments you leave.\n\nThank you for being along on this ride. Here’s to learning together.\n\nWhat’s the biggest lesson you’ve learned from sharing what you know online?\n\nStep 7 (Review):\n- Tone is friendly, humble, clear.\n- Only one em dash, used for effect in the hook.\n- Simple, scannable structure.\n- Specific personal experience is generalized (per user info), no assumptions made.\n- CTA is focused: just one question at the end.\n\nStep 8 (Final post):",
