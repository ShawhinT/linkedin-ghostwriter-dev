[Personal Reflection] “Today’s my birthday—here’s what last year looked like at a glance.”\n4. [Question/Challenge] “Ever measured your year in numbers? Here’s mine…”\n5. [Aha Moment] “You’d be surprised at what can happen in a year—just look at the numbers.”\n\nStep 5B: Add Notes to Each Angle\n1. Use very clear framing; matches user’s request\n2. Playful/numbers theme; softer entry\n3. Direct/personal announcement (could feel relatable)\n4. Invites others to reflect, immediately engaging\n5. Sets up a surprising reveal—good for teasing unexpected growth\n\nStep 5C: Pick Strongest and Write Hook\nChoosing option 3 for straightforward voice and directness.\n“Today’s my birthday—here’s what last year looked like by the numbers.”\n\nStep 6: Draft Full Post\nToday’s my birthday—here’s what last year looked like by the numbers.\n\n- [X] projects shipped (AI tools, client work, experiments)\n- [Y] pieces of content published (LinkedIn posts, YouTube videos, newsletters)\n- [Z] hours spent learning new things (from frameworks to business skills)\n- [N] new connections and collaborations\n- [Q] lessons learned—many of them the hard way\n\nReflecting on these numbers helps me appreciate how far I've come, but also reminds me there’s always room to grow.\n\nThanks to everyone who’s been along for the ride—whether you’ve liked, commented, collaborated, or just followed from afar. Truly grateful.\n\nWhat’s one number you’re proud of from your last year?\n\nStep 7: Review for Style, Voice, and Flow\n- Avoided more than one em dash\n- Minimal repeated phrasing in hook and body\n- Did not repeat hook in the body\n- No specifics about external content, per instructions\n- White space & bullets for scannability\n- Clear, expert, and friendly tone\n- One focused CTA\n\nStep 8: Final Post",
