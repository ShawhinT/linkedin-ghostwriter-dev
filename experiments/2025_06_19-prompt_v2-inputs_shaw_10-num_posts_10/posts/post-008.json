  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Share a personal milestone, reflect on the journey, and invite the audience along for the next phase.\n- Audience: Broad LinkedIn network—includes creators, students, and fellow entrepreneurs interested in content growth, AI, and entrepreneurship.\n\nStep 2: Post Wireframe\n[Milestone hook]\n[Personal reflection + brief journey]\n[Lessons/impact/general encouragement]\n[Call to action]\n\nStep 3: Write the Body (“meat”)\nHitting 50k subscribers is one of those milestones that felt out of reach not that long ago. It’s amazing to think about how a simple idea—sharing what I’m learning in AI and entrepreneurship—has resonated with so many people across the world.\n\nNone of this would’ve been possible without the small, messy starts. Cringe first videos, awkward lighting, and not a single view outside close family and friends. If you ever thought about starting a channel (or any creative project), this is your nudge: the beginning is always rough, but the only way to get here is to start.\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhat’s one project or goal you want to start (or restart) this year?\n\nStep 5: Hooks (brainstorm directions)\nA. [Milestone] 50,000 strangers decided to hit ‘subscribe’ on my YouTube.\nB. [Personal story] I still remember when my channel had 0 subscribers.\nC. [Encouragement] If you needed a sign to start, this is it.\nD. [Trend/urgency] YouTube is still the best place to learn in public—and here’s why I’m doubling down after 50k.\nE. [User’s phrasing] 50k subs YouTube milestone\n\nStep 5B: Notes for each direction\nA. Highlight the number, make it tangible\nB. Nostalgic perspective\nC. Direct nudge to audience\nD. Seen as an ‘inflection point’/commitment\nE. Plainly mark the milestone\n\nStep 5C: Choose strongest direction and write final hook\nI’ll go with A + C: “50,000 strangers hit subscribe… and if you’re waiting for a sign to start, consider this it.”\n\nStep 6: Draft the Full Post\n50,000 strangers hit subscribe… and if you’re waiting for a sign to start, consider this it.\n\nHitting 50k YouTube subscribers is one of those milestones that felt impossible at the start. I still remember the days of awkward videos, bad lighting, and refreshing the dashboard to see if a single person (who wasn't family) had watched.\n\nIf you’ve thought about starting a channel, project, or business—trust me, it never feels like the perfect time. The early days are rough for everyone. But those awkward first steps are what make moments like this possible.\n\nWhat’s one project or goal you want to start (or restart) this year?\n\nStep 7: Style, Voice, and Flow Review\n- No em dash stuffing (only one for flow)\n- Natural voice, humble, approachable, action-focused\n- Good white space\n- No assumed specifics about Shaw’s experience beyond the milestone and journey\n\nStep 8: Write the Final Post",

The early days are always rough. But taking those first, uncomfortable steps is the only way to get here.\n\nWhat’s one project or goal you want to start (or restart) this year?"
