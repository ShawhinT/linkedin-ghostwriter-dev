  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Educate (help newcomers take their first step in building an AI agent)\n- Audience: Beginners interested in AI, aspiring builders, technical learners on LinkedIn\n\nStep 2: Post Wireframe\n- Hook: Direct promise of practical outcome (language from user input)\n- Meat: Clarify what an AI agent is, explain that it's less intimidating than people think, list the very first simple steps one needs to take (e.g. pick a tool, define a task, use starter code/templates), offer encouragement (build > perfect)\n- CTA: Ask readers what kind of AI agent they'd like to build (single question)\n\nStep 3: Body\nToo many people get stuck thinking that AI agents are only for experts. But if you know a bit of Python and can follow clear steps, you can build something useful today! \n\nHere’s how to start:\n1) Pick one agent platform (LangChain, CrewAI, or Autogen)\n2) Choose a task: e.g., summarize articles, manage emails, or generate social posts\n3) Use their starter code/templates. Don’t try to build from scratch on day one—see what works, then tweak it\n\nThe key: Don’t aim for perfection. The first agent doesn’t have to be novel. It just has to work.\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhat’s the first agent you want to build?\n\nStep 5A: Brainstorm Hook Directions\n- [User phrasing] By the end of this post you'll be able to build your first AI agent\n- [Problem/solution] “Building an AI agent sounds intimidating. Here’s the fastest way to get started.”\n- [Finish line] “Most beginners wait months, but you can build your first agent in an afternoon.”\n- [Beginner misconception] “You don’t need to be an expert (or reinvent the wheel) to launch your own AI agent.”\n- [Checklist/how-to] “3 simple steps to go from zero to your first AI agent”\n\nStep 5B: Notes to Each\n- User phrasing: Direct, outcome-focused, fits the educational angle\n- Problem/solution: Addresses hesitation/fear, presents approachable solution\n- Finish line: Sets expectations, motivates quick action\n- Beginner misconception: Reassures readers, demystifies the process\n- Checklist: Emphasizes practical, actionable advice\n\nStep 5C: Choose strongest direction\nUser phrasing is a clear, direct promise—but I’ll punch up the curiosity slightly for LinkedIn engagement.\n\nStep 6: Write Full Post\nBy the end of this post, you’ll know exactly how to build your first AI agent—no PhD required.\n\nAI agents aren’t just for experts or big tech companies. If you can write basic Python and follow simple steps, you can build one too.\n\nHere’s the fastest way to start:\n\n1) Pick one agent platform (LangChain, CrewAI, or Autogen)\n2) Choose a practical task (like summarizing articles, sorting emails, or generating LinkedIn posts)\n3) Start with their beginner templates or starter code. Don’t build from scratch—tweak what’s already working!\n\nRemember: The goal isn’t perfection, it’s progress. Your first agent just needs to run—experiment and improve from there.\n\nWhat’s the first agent you want to try building?\n\nStep 7: Audit for flow, style, white space, em dash, repeated words, 1 CTA, authenticity (no implied personal claim), action-oriented, avoids jargon, clear and approachable.\n\nStep 8: Final post:",
