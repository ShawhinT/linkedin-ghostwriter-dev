  "writing_steps": "Step 1:\nPurpose: Educate and empower the audience; demystify the \"genius\" myth around top AI engineers and encourage hands-on practice.\nTarget audience: Aspiring AI engineers, learners, builders, and career switchers who may feel intimidated by perceived barriers.\n\nStep 2:\nWireframe:\n[Hook about top AI engineers not being inherently smarter]\n[Body emphasizing that building is the differentiator, not just intelligence]\n[Encouragement to start building now, not to wait for 'enough knowledge']\n[CTA: What project are you working on?]\n\nStep 3:\nMost people assume you need to be a genius to excel in AI.\n\nBut the reality? The engineers people admire most aren't that different from you—in terms of raw intelligence. The biggest separator is consistency in building. They:\n\n- Build projects even before they feel \"ready\"\n- Try new tools and approaches (and fail, frequently)\n- Learn by doing, not just by taking courses or reading papers\n\nEvery experiment, even the ones that flop, teaches something valuable. Over time, that experience compounds into real skill.\n\nStep 4:\nWhat project are you building right now?\n\nStep 5:\nStep 5A — Brainstorm hook directions:\n1. [User’s own phrasing] “Most top AI engineers aren’t more intelligent than you. They just do this one thing more… BUILD”\n2. [Problem/solution] “Feel stuck in AI because you think you’re not smart enough? Here’s what sets the top engineers apart.”\n3. [Results/outcomes] “The best AI engineers got there by doing this simple thing, not by being smarter.”\n4. [Trend/urgency] “AI is moving fast—but you won’t get left behind if you keep building.”\n\nStep 5B — Notes:\n1. User’s own phrasing is direct and addresses mindset.\n2. Many aspiring engineers feel intimidated—the solution is to build.\n3. Results: Building, over time, leads to becoming the “top engineer.”\n4. Trend: Pace of AI is intimidating, but building is a way to keep up.\n\nStep 5C — Chosen hook: User’s own phrasing is strongest, feels authentic and bold.\n\nStep 6:\nMost top AI engineers aren’t more intelligent than you.\nThey just do this one thing more… BUILD\n\nPeople often assume there's some unbridgeable gap between themselves and the people doing impressive work in AI.\n\nBut, in my experience, the real separator is consistent action:\n\n- Shipping projects—even when you feel underprepared\n- Experimenting with new tools (and failing, a lot)\n- Learning by doing projects, not just reading or watching\n\nThe secret isn’t genius—it’s momentum. The more you build, the faster you grow.\n\nWhat project are you building right now?\n\nStep 7 — Review:\n- No repeated phrases, one em dash.\n- Inviting and warm tone, actionable encouragement, single focused CTA.\n- White space and bullets for flow.\n- Sticks closely to user’s language and core insight.\n\nStep 8 — Final post below.",
  "final_post": "Most top AI engineers aren’t more intelligent than you.\nThey just do this one thing more… BUILD\n\nIt’s easy to assume the people building with AI are operating on some unreachable level of talent or intelligence.\n\nBut in reality, the biggest difference is consistency:\n\n- Shipping projects—even if you don’t feel ready\n- Experimenting with new tools (and failing, constantly)\n- Learning by building things, not just reading or watching\n\nGenius is overrated. Forward momentum comes from taking action—again and again.\n\nWhat project are you building right now?"
