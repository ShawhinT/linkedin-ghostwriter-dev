  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Educate and reflect on key AI principles learned with experience; share lessons/guidance for newer AI practitioners.\n- Audience: Aspiring AI engineers/researchers, early-career data scientists, anyone entering the AI field.\n\nStep 2: Post Wireframe\n- Hook: Regret/reflection angle (\"5 AI truths I wish I knew at 24\" or similar)\n- Meat: List the 5 principles, each with a short reflection or explanation for clarity\n- CTA: Ask which principle resonates most\n\nStep 3: The Body (“Meat”)\n\nHere are 5 lessons I’d give my younger self:\n\n1. Don't use AI just for the sake of it. Often, the simplest tech solves the problem just fine.\n2. Obsess over the problem, not the tools. Technology changes. The problems (and impact) stay constant.\n3. Spend more time curating your data than you think you need to. Your model is only as good as what you feed it.\n4. Data quality > data quantity. A handful of clean, relevant examples will do more for your project than a thousand noisy ones.\n5. Always run experiments. Don’t assume—test, iterate, and learn from every result.\n\nStep 4: CTA/Question\nWhich of these principles would’ve helped you most earlier in your career?\n\nStep 5A: Brainstormed Hook Directions\n- [User’s own phrasing]: “AI principles I know at 29, I wish I had known at 24.”\n- [Problem/solution]: “Most people obsess over tech, not the problem.”\n- [Personal reflection/regret]: “If I could rewind time by 5 years…”\n- [Beginner-to-expert clarity]: “Most starting out in AI get distracted by the latest tools. Here’s what matters more.”\n\nStep 5B: Flesh out with notes\n- [User’s phrasing]: Honest, direct reflection—sounds like a list of hard-earned lessons\n- [Problem/solution]: Highlights how learning to focus on the right thing speeds up progress\n- [Personal reflection]: Positions as an older-you-to-younger-you letter\n- [Beginner-to-expert]: Challenges a common misconception; sets Shaw up as a clarifying voice\n\nStep 5C: Choose strongest hook\nUser’s own phrasing is strong and direct. Will slightly rephrase for punchiness: \n“5 AI truths I know at 29 (that I wish I learned at 24)”\n\nStep 6: Draft Full Post\n5 AI truths I know at 29 (that I wish I learned at 24)\n\nIf I could send one list back to myself a few years ago, it’d be this:\n\n1. Don’t use AI unless you need it. The simplest solution is usually best.\n2. Focus on solving real problems, not chasing the latest tech.\n3. Spend extra time curating your data. Quality inputs beat clever algorithms.\n4. Data quality > data quantity. A small, clean set can outperform a big, messy one.\n5. Run experiments, not assumptions. Test, iterate, and let the results teach you.\n\nWhich one would’ve helped you most early on?\n\nStep 7: Review\n- Only one em dash (in the title)—fine for voice\n- No repeated phrases or numbers\n- CTA is singular and actionable\n- Scannable, clear points, in Shaw’s voice\n\nStep 8: Final Post",
  "final_post": "5 AI truths I know at 29 (that I wish I’d learned at 24)\n\nIf I could send just one list back to my younger self, it’d look like this:\n\n1. Don’t use AI just because you can. The simplest tech often solves the problem better.\n2. Focus on solving problems, not chasing tools.\n3. Spend more time curating your data than you think you need. This is almost always the highest ROI work you can do.\n4. Data quality > data quantity. A handful of good examples beats a mountain of noise.\n5. Always run experiments. Don’t rely on intuition—test, iterate, and learn from the process.\n\nWhich one would’ve helped you most early in your AI journey?"
