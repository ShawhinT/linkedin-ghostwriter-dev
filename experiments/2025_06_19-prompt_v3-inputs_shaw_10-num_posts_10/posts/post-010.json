  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Inspire ongoing learning and frame 'wealth' as mental, not financial; gentle nudge to value knowledge over money.\n- Audience: Broad—friends, fellow entrepreneurs, lifelong learners, anyone looking for motivation or perspective.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n[Hook: Insightful reminder about true wealth]\n[Meat: Expand on why learning is the truest form of wealth, link to ongoing journey, brief reflection]\n[CTA: Invite readers to share something they're learning right now]\n\nStep 3: Body/Meat\nWhen people talk about being “rich,” most focus on the number in their bank account.\n\nBut I’ve found (time and again) that the real leverage comes from what you know—not just what you earn.\n\nInvesting in your skills, surrounding yourself with people who challenge you, and being a curious learner pays dividends far beyond a paycheck.\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhat’s one thing you’re learning right now that’s expanding your mind?\n\nStep 5: Hook Directions Brainstorm\n1. [User’s own phrasing]: “Being rich isn’t about what’s in your bank account, but what’s in your mind.”\n2. [Problem/solution]: You can lose money. You can’t lose knowledge.\n3. [Personal story]: How investing in learning led to more opportunities than chasing a bigger salary.\n4. [Beginner-to-expert clarity]: Most overestimate money and underestimate continuous learning.\n5. [Results]: The long-term ROI of skills vs. cash in your 20s.\n\nHook Notes:\n1. [User’s phrasing]: Captures the spirit, direct.\n2. [Problem/solution]: Contrasts fleeting money with permanent knowledge.\n3. [Personal story]: Only if personal details exist; skip for now.\n4. [Beginner-to-expert clarity]: A “mistake” many make.\n5. [Results]: Teases long-term impact, but can come across as preachy w/out data.\n\nStep 6: Draft\nBeing rich isn’t about your bank account—it’s about your mindset.\n\nThe people who become truly “wealthy” are those always expanding what they know. Over time, deep curiosity ends up compounding in ways money alone never could.\n\nWhenever I’ve focused on learning and building, new opportunities always followed. Financial results became a byproduct—not a goal.\n\nSo if you’re prioritizing skill building over only chasing income: keep going. The real payoff comes later (often in unexpected ways).\n\nWhat’s one thing you’re learning right now that’s expanding your mind?\n\nStep 7: Review\n- Em dash use: Only in hook for contrast; rest is clean.\n- Good white space and flow.\n- Factual, gentle advice, rooted in observation, not personal claims.\n- Clear single CTA.\n- Voice: Approachable, factual, honest—a peer.\n\nStep 8: Final Post",
  "final_post": "Being rich isn’t about your bank account—it’s about your mindset.\n\nFocusing on what you know (and how you keep learning) pays dividends far beyond your paycheck.\n\nEvery time I’ve invested in building new skills or surrounding myself with people who challenge me, new opportunities have followed. Financial results become a byproduct—not the main goal.\n\nIf you’re prioritizing growth over just chasing income: keep going. The real payoff comes in unexpected ways.\n\nWhat’s one thing you’re learning right now that’s expanding your mind?"
