  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Educate and share hard-earned insights/principles about working with AI, with a personal growth and hindsight angle (things Shaw wishes he knew earlier).\n- Audience: Early-career AI engineers, data scientists, builders—especially those just starting or a few years into their journey.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n[Hook: Reflective, age-based lesson framing]\n[Body: Expand briefly on each principle as a list with a short explanation]\n[CTA: Invite readers to share their own lessons or principles they wish they'd known earlier]\n\nStep 3: Body\nHere’s what I wish I’d focused on sooner:\n\n- Don’t use AI (just because it’s AI): If you don’t need it, don’t force it into your stack.\n- Focus on problems, not tech: Let the problem guide your solution, not the hype train.\n- Spend more time on data curation: Strong data always > fancy models.\n- Data quality > data quantity: 1k good examples beats 100k noisy ones.\n- Run experiments: The only way to find out what works is to test, not just theorize.\n\nStep 4: CTA or Question\nWhat’s an AI or data science principle you wish you’d learned earlier?\n\nStep 5A: Potential hook directions\n- [Age-based personal reflection]: “AI principles I know at 29, I wish I had known at 24.”\n- [Problem/solution]: “Most early-career AI folks get these 5 things backwards…here’s what really matters.”\n- [Beginner-to-expert clarity]: “I spent years chasing the wrong things in AI. Here’s a shortlist that actually works.”\n- [Results/outcomes]: “After 5 years in AI, these are my go-to principles for building anything that works.”\n- [User’s own phrasing]: “AI principles I know at 29, I wish I had known at 24.”\n\nStep 5B: Short notes to flesh out hooks\n- [Age-based reflection]: Emphasize lessons with clear, specific framing; relatable for those a few years behind\n- [Problem/solution]: “Don’t get lost in the tech—solve real problems, curate your data”\n- [Beginner-to-expert clarity]: “I wasted years on tech trends—data quality and experiments beat anything else”\n- [Results/outcomes]: “These 5 habits consistently yield better results, not hype”\n\nStep 5C: Choose hook direction\nThe age-based reflective hook is strongest. It centers on relatable hindsight and positions the advice as coming from real experience, not theory.\n\nStep 6: Draft of full post\nAI principles I know at 29, I wish I had known at 24.\n\nHere’s what I wish I’d focused on sooner:\n\n- Don’t use AI (just because it’s AI): If you don’t need it, don’t force it into your stack.\n- Focus on problems, not tech: Let the problem guide your solution, not the hype train.\n- Spend more time on data curation: Strong data always > fancy models.\n- Data quality > data quantity: 1k good examples beats 100k noisy ones.\n- Run experiments: The only way to find out what works is to test, not just theorize.\n\nWhat’s an AI or data science principle you wish you’d learned earlier?\n\nStep 7: Style, Voice, and Flow Audit\n- Clear, honest, actionable language\n- Uses simple phrasing, not hype or rhetorical questions\n- List structure is scannable\n- No repeated phrases or tricolons with negation\n- Ending question is focused and specific\n\nStep 8: Final Post",
  "final_post": "AI principles I know at 29—I wish I’d had these at 24.\n\nHere’s what I learned the hard way:\n\n- Don’t use AI just because it’s AI. If it doesn’t solve the problem, skip it.\n- Focus on problems, not tech. Let real challenges lead your stack—not headlines.\n- Spend more time on data curation. The right data matters more than fancy models.\n- Data quality > data quantity. One thousand clean examples beat a hundred thousand noisy ones.\n- Run experiments. Don’t guess—test.\n\nWhat’s an AI (or data science) principle you wish you’d learned earlier?"
