  "writing_steps": "Step 1: \n- Purpose: Share Shaw's key lessons learned from going from $0 to $70k (likely in solopreneurship/AI/content). This post is meant to share his path honestly, inspire, and offer tactical insights to others on a similar path.\n- Audience: Fellow entrepreneurs, aspiring solopreneurs, and those starting out in AI or content creation who want to learn from Shaw’s direct experience.\n\nStep 2 (Wireframe):\n[Short, factual hook about the 0 to $70k milestone]\n[3–5 most significant lessons, each with a headline and explanation—keep it personal and actionable]\n[One focused CTA/question]\n\nStep 3 (Body):\nSince the user only gave a title, do not assume specifics. Instead, use 'the 0 to $70k' journey as a prompt for general, common lessons and advice drawn from early solopreneur and AI educator experiences, keeping it honest and practical.\n\n- Start small, iterate fast: You don't need a perfect launch—just something real people can use.\n- Learn out loud: Sharing what you're learning (even when you feel like a beginner) attracts opportunities.\n- Platform matters less than consistency: I tried different channels—sticking with one and showing up regularly was more important than picking the “right” one.\n- Diversify cautiously: Multiple income streams sound good, but start by mastering one thing before expanding.\n- Failure is feedback: The biggest leaps came right after flops or projects that went nowhere. Treat every result as data, not a verdict.\n\nStep 4 (CTA or question):\nWhat’s been your biggest lesson in the early days of your journey?\n\nStep 5 (Hook—Brainstorm directions):\nA. [Milestone/Result]: \"What I learned going from 0 to $70k as a solopreneur\"\nB. [Problem/Solution]: \"Most people focus on the wrong things when starting out—here’s what actually moved the needle for me.\"\nC. [Reflection]: \"Looking back at my journey from 0 to $70k, 5 lessons stand out.\"\nD. [Number Hook]: \"5 lessons from my first $70k in online business.\"\nE. [User’s own phrasing]: \"My Journey from 0 to 70k (key lessons)\"\n\nStep 5B (Annotate):\nA. Direct and factual—matches Shaw’s usual milestone announcements.\nB. Edgy, but possibly speculative—avoid overclaim since the user said \"lessons.\"\nC. Reflective, humble, fits Shaw’s transparent style.\nD. Listicle—clear structure. Could feel clickbaity if not worded carefully.\nE. Honest but not catchy as a hook.\n\nStep 5C: Choose C or A, since both feel authentic and fact-based.\n\nFinal Hook:\nLooking back at my journey from 0 to $70k, here are the 5 lessons that mattered most.\n\nStep 6 (Draft):\nLooking back at my journey from 0 to $70k, here are the 5 lessons that mattered most.\n\n1. Start small, iterate fast.\n   You don’t need a perfect launch—just something real people can use and give feedback on.\n\n2. Learn out loud.\n   Sharing what you’re learning (even as a beginner) attracts opportunities and next steps.\n\n3. Platform matters less than consistency.\n   I tried different channels, but showing up regularly outperformed any “hack.”\n\n4. Diversify cautiously.\n   Multiple income streams sound smart, but mastering one area first gave me the momentum to expand later.\n\n5. Failure is feedback.\n   The biggest breakthroughs almost always came after flops or ideas that went nowhere. Every result is just more data to learn from.\n\nWhat’s been your biggest lesson in the early days of your journey?\n\nStep 7 (Review):\n- No motivational or challenge language.\n- Each lesson is specific and actionable.\n- The hook is factual and reflective—not rhetorical or tricolon.\n- Only one em dash total.\n- Invites honest discussion.\n- Structure matches Shaw’s style: scannable, direct, educational.\n\nStep 8: Write final post.",
