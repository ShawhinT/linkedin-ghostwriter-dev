  "writing_steps": "Step 1:\n- Purpose: Educate readers by demystifying and lowering the barrier to building an AI agent. (Possibly as a content post or an intro guide.)\n- Target audience: Beginners or those curious about building AI agents for the first time—likely technical newcomers, early-career engineers, or entrepreneurs interested in AI agents.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n- Hook: Promise the reader a tangible outcome (they'll be able to build their first AI agent).\n- The meat: Brief overview of what an agent is, then break down the first steps to get started (\n   - Choose a use case or goal, select a framework, basic components, useful starter resources or minimal code.)\n- CTA: Ask what kinds of agent projects readers are interested in, or what’s holding them back from starting.\n\nStep 3: Write the meat\nBuilding your first AI agent sounds intimidating—but it really boils down to a handful of steps:\n\n- Step 1: Pick a use case. (Start simple. For example: email summarizer, calendar assistant, or text parser.)\n- Step 2: Decide if you want to use a no-code tool (like Zapier or GPTs) or go hands-on with Python (e.g., LangChain, openAI API).\n- Step 3: Define the agent's input (what do you want it to process), output (what will it return?), and tools (APIs, info sources).\n- Step 4: Use an existing template or repo as your starting point. Tweak instead of building from scratch—learn by modifying working code.\n- Step 5: Get feedback early. Try it on a real task, see what breaks or feels clunky, then improve one thing at a time.\n\nIf you follow this process, you’ll have a working agent prototype faster than you think.\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhat’s the first AI agent you’d want to build?\n\nStep 5A: Brainstorm hook directions\n- [User’s own phrasing]: \"By the end of this post you'll be able to build your first AI agent\"\n- [Problem/solution]: Building your first AI agent feels hard, but it's mostly about a few simple steps.\n- [Beginner-to-expert]: Most people overcomplicate agents, but a working demo is closer than you think.\n- [Personal story]: The first agent I built was basic—but it did its job and taught me a ton.\n- [Numbers/Outcome]: 5 steps to your first AI agent. No PhD required.\n\nStep 5B: Notes on directions\n- [User’s phrasing]: Direct promise, outcome-oriented.\n- [Problem/solution]: Could open with \"Most people think agents are complicated.\"\n- [Beginner-to-expert]: Exposing that simple agents can be built quickly.\n- [Personal story]: Not used here, as no details provided.\n- [Numbers/Outcome]: \"5 steps\" format, clarity.\n\nStep 5C: Choose and write the hook\nUser’s own phrasing is clear, direct, and promising—fits Shaw’s actionable, demystifying style. Best for this post.\nFinal Hook: By the end of this post, you’ll be able to build your first AI agent.\n\nStep 6: Full post draft\nBy the end of this post, you’ll be able to build your first AI agent.\n\nBuilding an AI agent sounds intimidating—but it really comes down to a handful of steps:\n\n- Pick a simple use case (email summarizer, calendar assistant, text analyzer)\n- Decide whether to go no-code (Zapier, GPTs) or code-first (Python, LangChain, OpenAI API)\n- Define what your agent will take as input, what it should output, and what tools or APIs it might need\n- Start from a template or existing repo—don’t build from scratch. Learn by tweaking sample code.\n- Get feedback early by testing on a real task; improve one thing at a time based on what you see\n\nDon’t worry about perfection on your first try. You’ll learn more by launching something basic and improving from there.\n\nWhat’s the first AI agent you’d want to build?\n\nStep 7: Style, voice, flow audit\n- Only one em dash used, justified for clarity.\n- No repeated phrases in the opening lines.\n- Body is not a rehash of hook.\n- Clarity, scannability via bullets; direct, helpful, no hype.\n- Ends with a single, focused question.\n- Voice is educational, actionable, and matches example posts.\n\nStep 8: Final post follows.",

It’s the fastest path to real learning.\n- Test early on a real task. Look for what breaks, make small improvements, and repeat.\n\nThe first version doesn’t have to be perfect. What matters is getting something working that teaches you along the way.\n\nWhat’s the first AI agent you’d want to build?"
