  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose and Audience\n- Purpose: Encourage and inspire those interested in AI engineering by demystifying what separates top engineers and motivating action through building.\n- Audience: Aspiring AI engineers, technical learners, students, and early-career practitioners who may feel intimidated by top professionals in the field.\n\nStep 2: Post Wireframe\n[Hook]\nMost top AI engineers aren’t more intelligent than you. They just do this one thing more…\n\n[Meat]\nWhen you look at the top 1% of AI engineers, it's easy to assume they’re simply on another level of intelligence.\nBut here’s what I keep seeing:\n\n- They actively build projects, large and small.\n- They aren’t afraid to ship “bad” versions to learn fast.\n- They focus on learning-by-doing instead of passively consuming.\n\nIt’s not that they never struggle or make mistakes—but experimentation is built into their workflow.\n\nIf you’re just getting started, it’s tempting to wait until you “know enough.” In reality, the learning curve bends in your favor once you put projects out into the world. \n\n[CTA]\nWhat project are you building next?\n\nStep 3: Write the Body\nWhen you look at the top 1% of AI engineers, it's easy to assume they’re simply on another level of intelligence.\nBut here’s what I keep seeing:\n- They actively build projects, large and small.\n- They aren’t afraid to ship “bad” versions to learn fast.\n- They focus on learning-by-doing instead of passively consuming.\n\nIt’s not that they never struggle or make mistakes—but experimentation is built into their workflow. If you’re just getting started, it’s tempting to wait until you “know enough.” In reality, the learning curve bends in your favor once you put projects out into the world. \n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhat project are you building next?\n\nStep 5: Hook Directions\n1. [User’s own phrasing] Most top AI engineers aren’t more intelligent than you. They just do this one thing more… BUILD\n2. [Problem/solution] Many believe top AI talent is about raw intelligence—actually, it’s about taking action through building.\n3. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] The biggest differentiator isn’t IQ, it’s project reps.\n4. [Personal story/observation] What I notice among standout engineers isn’t genius—it’s relentless building.\n\nStep 5B: Notes\n1. Use user phrase, direct and impactful.\n2. Clarify that taking action separates good from great.\n3. Focus on myth-busting around intelligence.\n4. Share personal observation (if user had supplied).\n\nStep 5C: Chosen Hook—use user's own phrasing since it's strong and direct.\n\nStep 6: Draft Full Post\nMost top AI engineers aren’t more intelligent than you. They just do this one thing more… BUILD\n\nWhen you look at the top 1% of AI engineers, it's easy to assume they’re simply on another level of intelligence.\n\nBut here’s what I keep seeing:\n- They consistently build projects—of all sizes.\n- They aren’t afraid to ship “bad” versions and iterate fast.\n- They focus on learning-by-doing, not just reading papers or watching tutorials.\n\nIt’s not that they don’t hit roadblocks (they do). The difference is: they turn every failure into a lesson—because experimentation is built into their workflow.\n\nIf you’re just getting started, waiting until you “know enough” is a trap. You’ll gain real confidence once you put something into the world and learn from it.\n\nWhat project are you building next?\n\nStep 7: Review for Style, Voice, Flow\n- Clarity > cleverness, check.\n- No rhetorical question opener.\n- Direct, honest, factual tone.\n- No personal anecdote beyond observed patterns.\n- Only one em dash.\n- White space and bullets good.\n\nStep 8: Final Post",
