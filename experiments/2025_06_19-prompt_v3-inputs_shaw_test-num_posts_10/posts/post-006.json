  "writing_steps": "Step 1: \n- Purpose: Educate (break down the differences between corporate and freelance data science roles)\n- Target Audience: Data scientists considering a career switch, aspiring freelancers, and those curious about industry roles\n\nStep 2: Post wireframe:\n[Hook]\n[Key differences bullet list: workflows, autonomy, challenges, growth]\n[Invite further examples from the audience]\n\nStep 3: The meat:\nFrom my experience and what I see in the data science community, transitioning between corporate and freelance roles isn’t just about a new business card—it changes how you approach projects, collaborate, and even measure success.\n\nHere’s how the two differ:\n\nIn corporate data science:\n- Structured teams (product managers, data engineers, analysts)\n- Stable workflows and organized projects\n- Clear promotion paths and professional development\n- Projects often align with established business objectives\n\nIn freelance/contracting:\n- You’re a “team of one” (from scoping to deployment)\n- Continuous client acquisition and self-marketing\n- Varied projects with less predictable scope\n- More autonomy, but also more business admin and risk\n\nStep 4: CTA or question:\nWhat’s one difference you’d add between freelance and corporate data science?\n\nStep 5: Brainstorm hook angles\nA. [Problem/solution] Most data scientists only see one side—here’s what’s different when you switch.\nB. [Trend/urgency] As more move to freelance, understanding the differences is key.\nC. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] Switching from corporate to freelance? Here’s what changes.\nD. [User phrasing] Corporate vs freelance data science: key differences no one tells you about.\n\nStep 5A: Label and notes:\nA. [Problem/solution] – “Many are curious but aren’t sure how roles change.”\nB. [Trend/urgency] – “Freelancing is on the rise; know before you leap.”\nC. [Beginner-to-expert] – “Advice for those eyeing the switch—fewer surprises.”\nD. [User phrasing] – “Key differences—simple, direct.”\n\nStep 5C: Strongest direction: C – clarity for those switching/career planning\nFinal hook: Planning a move from corporate to freelance data science? Here are the practical differences (from projects to paychecks).\n\nStep 6: Full draft:\nPlanning a move from corporate to freelance data science? Here are the practical differences (from projects to paychecks).\n\nFrom what I’ve seen (and heard from many making this switch), these two paths feel like different jobs entirely.\n\nIn corporate data science:\n• Structured teams—often a product manager, engineering partners, and support from other analysts\n• Consistent projects that align with company goals\n• Predictable salary, formal growth paths\n• Clear workflows and role expectations\n\nIn freelance (or contracting):\n• You’re responsible for everything—scoping, delivery, and landing the next gig\n• Projects (and income) fluctuate each month\n• More autonomy and flexibility\n• Greater need for self-marketing and context-switching across industries\n\nEach has its tradeoffs—corporate offers stability and specialization, freelance offers breadth and independence.\n\nWhat’s one difference you’d add between freelance and corporate data science?\n\nStep 7: Review for style, voice, flow:\n- Factual, clear, organized\n- Not motivational\n- No made-up personal experience\n- No repeated phrases\n- Bullets for readability\n- Direct and humble\n- Zero more than one call-to-action\n\nStep 8: Final post:\n",
