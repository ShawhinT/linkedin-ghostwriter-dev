  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Share a new blog post about deploying machine learning solutions, educate/drive traffic to the blog\n- Target Audience: Engineers, data scientists, ML practitioners, and tech entrepreneurs interested in practical ML deployment\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n[Hook]\n[Short intro: why deploying ML solutions can be a challenge/the importance]\n[Quick summary of what the blog covers: FastAPI, Docker, GCP]\n[Link to blog]\n[CTA: ask about readers' deployment stack]\n\nStep 3: Body (“Meat”)\nDeploying machine learning systems isn’t just about getting the model to work in a notebook—real results come when you can ship it into production. But bridging the gap can be intimidating.\n\nIn my latest blog, I break down how to deploy an ML solution using three core technologies:\n- FastAPI for creating a lightweight, production-ready API\n- Docker for consistent packaging and easy deployment\n- Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for scalable hosting\n\nEach step comes with practical explanations and plenty of code. The goal: to demystify the end-to-end process so you can confidently ship your next project.\n\nLink: [add blog link here]\n\nStep 4: CTA/Question\nWhat’s your go-to stack for shipping machine learning models?\n\nStep 5A: Hook directions\n- [Problem/solution] \"Getting ML projects into production is its own challenge...\"\n- [Beginner/clarity] \"Most tutorials stop at ‘fit the model’ — here’s what actually gets models into real apps.\"\n- [Trend] \"ML deployment is evolving—here’s a workflow that works in 2024.\"\n- [User’s phrasing] \"How to Deploy ML Solutions with FastAPI, Docker, and GCP\"\n\nStep 5B: Notes\n- Problem/solution: Emphasize that shipping models, not just building, is key.\n- Beginner/clarity: Address the gap between research code and production.\n- Trend: Note modern tools (FastAPI, Docker, GCP)\n- User: Direct and descriptive, could work well if formality is needed.\n\nStep 5C: Pick the strongest: I’ll go with the ‘problem/solution’ hook, as it directly addresses a pain point and is relatable to the audience.\n\nStep 6: Draft post\nMoving an ML model from your laptop to production can feel like a black box.\n\nI just published a step-by-step blog on deploying machine learning solutions using FastAPI, Docker, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).\n\nIn this guide, I cover:\n- Building a simple API around your ML model with FastAPI\n- Packaging your app for easy deployment with Docker\n- Hosting and scaling on GCP\n\nEach section has code snippets and explanations—all focused on making ML deployment less intimidating.\n\nBlog: [add link here]\n\nWhat’s your go-to stack for shipping machine learning models?\n\nStep 7: Style/voice/flow review\n- Factual, approachable, not hypey.\n- Focuses on practicality and demystifying a common challenge.\n- Uses white space and bullet points.\n- Ends with a single, direct question.\n- No motivational or challenge-driven language.\n\nStep 8: Final Post",
