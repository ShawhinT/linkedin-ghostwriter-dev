[Beginner-to-expert clarity] “Building an AI dev environment feels overwhelming—here's the 5-step stack I've built from scratch.”\nB. [User's phrasing] “My AI development setup from scratch.”\nC. [Problem/solution] “Setting up your AI dev stack can be confusing, but here are the exact tools I use to keep it simple.”\nD. [Results/outcomes] “Got a blank Mac? Here's how I set it up for frictionless AI projects.”\nE. [Listicle/curiosity] “5 tools I install on every fresh machine for AI projects.”\n\nStep 5B: Notes\nA. Emphasizes how to go from zero to ready\nB. Direct from user—straightforward, but may not tease value\nC. Focus on removing confusion and sharing clarity\nD. Paints a scenario—blank slate, beginner friendly\nE. Listicle structure, invites curiosity\n\nStep 5C: Choose the strongest direction and write final hook\nPicked (A): “Building an AI dev environment feels overwhelming—here's the 5-step stack I've built from scratch.”\n\nStep 6: Draft the full post\nBuilding an AI dev environment feels overwhelming—here's the 5-step stack I've built from scratch.\n\nIf you're setting up your machine for AI projects, I recommend starting with these tools:\n\n1. Xcode – For macOS command line tools (a must-have if you're on a Mac).\n2. Homebrew – My go-to package manager for installing everything else cleanly.\n3. Python – The foundation of most AI work (I always install the latest version with Homebrew).\n4. GitHub CLI – Makes working with repositories and Github projects much smoother.\n5. Cursor – An AI-first code editor that's become core to my workflow.\n\nWith this stack, I'm ready to tackle most AI projects without friction.\n\nWhat's one tool you can't live without in your AI dev setup?\n\nStep 7: Review for style, voice, flow\n- Factual, straightforward, conversational.\n- White space and bullets for readability.\n- Clear CTA (ONLY one question at the end—passed checklist)\n- No rhetorical questions or motivational fluff, voice consistent with example posts.\n- One em dash used in the hook—OK for clarity.\n\nStep 8: Final post below.",
