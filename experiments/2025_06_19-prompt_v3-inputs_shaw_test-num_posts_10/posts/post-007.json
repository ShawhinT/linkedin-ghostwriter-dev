  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Educate fellow technical people or aspiring data entrepreneurs about the importance of non-technical skills for success in entrepreneurial ventures.\n- Audience: Data scientists, ML engineers, technical professionals considering entrepreneurship, current data entrepreneurs wanting to level up.\n\nStep 2: Post Wireframe\n- Hook: Strong, list-style hook highlighting “non-technical” skills needed to succeed.\n- Body: List out the 10 non-technical skills, with one-liners or short expansions as appropriate, reflecting on why each matters.\n- CTA: Ask readers which non-technical skill they found hardest to learn (or are struggling with now).\n\nStep 3: The Body (\"Meat\")\nMost of my technical training didn’t prepare me for the realities of running a data business. \nHere are 10 non-technical skills I had to learn the hard way:\n\n1. Explaining technical ideas to non-technical people\n2. Talking to customers (and actually listening)\n3. Formulating business problems (not just technical ones)\n4. Asking good questions (especially when a project is fuzzy)\n5. Validating product/service ideas (before writing code)\n6. Responding to emails quickly (speed really matters)\n7. Sales (yes, you can’t avoid this)\n8. Warm outreach (not just cold emails, but real conversations)\n9. Making a landing page (simplicity > design)\n10.

Slight tweak for clarity/voice.\n\nFinal Hook: 10 non-technical skills I had to learn to survive as a data entrepreneur\n\nStep 6: Full Draft\n10 non-technical skills I had to learn to survive as a data entrepreneur\n\nMost of my technical training didn’t prepare me for the realities of running a data business.\n\nHere are 10 non-technical skills I had to pick up along the way:\n\n1.
