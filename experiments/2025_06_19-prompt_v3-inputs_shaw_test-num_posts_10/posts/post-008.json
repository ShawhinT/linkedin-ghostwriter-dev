  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Educate and validate the journey of becoming a (data) entrepreneur by sharing the key skills/lessons required, encouraging others who are on or considering this path.\n- Audience: Aspiring data entrepreneurs, solo founders, tech professionals thinking about entrepreneurship, and those early in the data/AI startup journey.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n[Hook] (Short, curiosity-driven, and relatable)\n[Body] (List of lessons/skills, with some brief clarifying comments or grouping)\n[CTA] (Invite others to share what they’d add)\n\nStep 3: Body\nBriefly walk through the 15 lessons, perhaps grouped into categories (technical, business, mindset), and add a sentence or two of context. Not too much detail—keep scannable. \n\nStep 4: CTA or Question\nWhat did you have to learn that surprised you most?\n\nStep 5: Brainstorm Hook Directions\nA. [User's own phrasing] “15 things I had to learn to become a (data) entrepreneur” (direct, listicle)\nB. [Problem/solution] “You know data science. But are you ready for entrepreneurship? Here’s what actually matters.”\nC. [Personal story] “I thought my data skills were enough. I was wrong. Here are 15 things I HAD to learn.”\nD. [Numbers/list] “Beyond the code: 15 non-negotiable skills for data entrepreneurs”\n\nNotes:\nA. User’s framing is clear, numbered, factual. \nB. Good for exposing the contrast between technical and real-world startup skills.\nC. May imply a deeper personal story—need to avoid extrapolation not given in input.\nD. Plays up “beyond the code”—shifts attention to business/mindset.\n\nStep 5C: Pick strongest direction\nA (User's own phrasing) aligns with Shaw’s style—honest, practical, concrete list. Will keep direct and use number/list format.\n\nStep 6: Draft the full post\n[Hook]\n15 things I had to learn to become a (data) entrepreneur — and most weren’t what I expected.\n\n[Body]\nEveryone expects you’ll need coding skills. Maybe some AI tool know-how. But the truth is: making the jump from data professional to data entrepreneur means building a *much* broader toolkit.\n\nHere are 15 things I actually had to learn:\n\nTechnical\n- Identify real pain points\n- Code beyond analysis—building things people want\n- Use AI tools effectively (not just dabble)\n\nBusiness & Clients\n- Sell (even if it feels awkward)\n- Talk to clients (and actually listen)\n- Do cold outbound (no, it doesn’t get easier)\n\nMarketing & Content\n- Write (emails, pitches, docs)\n- Make a website (quickly)\n- Just post (overthinking kills momentum)\n- Make content (not just read it)\n\nMindset & Growth\n- Look foolish (often)\n- Constantly learn—still, every week\n\nSome of these I expected. Most were harder than I thought. All of them matter a lot more than I’d guessed.\n\n[CTA]\nWhat did you have to learn that surprised you most?\n\nStep 7: Review for style, voice, and flow\n- Em dash audit: 2 em dashes—will consider using just one. Edit for clarity if needed.\n- Avoided repeated words in hook/first lines\n- Hook does not simply restate main points\n- Bullet lists used; grouped skills; clear, non-motivational tone\n- Factual, practical, and educational; direct, honest\n- Only one CTA (spot-checked)\n- Conforms to Shaw’s typical style\n\nStep 8: Final Post",
  "final_post": "15 things I had to learn to become a (data) entrepreneur—most had nothing to do with code.\n\nWhen people talk about this path, they focus on technical skills. But the real journey forced me to learn way more, much faster, than I’d expected.\n\nHere’s my quick list:\n\nTechnical skills\n- Spot real pain points (not just technical curiosities)\n- Build things people actually want—not just prototypes\n- Use AI tools, for real projects\n\nBusiness & clients\n- Sell (even when it feels uncomfortable)\n- Talk to clients and really listen\n- Reach out cold (it never feels less weird)\n\nMarketing & content\n- Write (so much more than you think)\n- Make a website (quick and dirty works)\n- Post consistently (don’t overthink)\n- Make content that teaches and connects\n\nMindset & growth\n- Look foolish (yep, it’s part of it)\n- Keep learning, every week\n\nSome days I’m still working on these. But every single one matters if you want to go beyond just “having data skills.”\n\nWhat did *you* have to learn that surprised you most?"
