  "writing_steps": "Step 1:\n- Purpose: Reflect and share milestones from the past year as a birthday post. Small personal brand moment; inspires, recaps, and connects.\n- Target audience: Broad professional network—potential students, fellow entrepreneurs, LinkedIn followers.\n\nStep 2:\nWireframe:\n\n[Hook: Numbers-based highlight or observation about a year of growth]\n\n[Body: Recap key stats and learnings from the past year—short, punchy, honest.]\n\n[CTA: Invite the audience to share their milestone or biggest lesson from the past year.]\n\nStep 3:\nBody:\n- Share the past year \"by the numbers\" (newsletter subscribers, product shipped, videos published, etc.—generic, as no specifics given).\n- Reflect on one or two general lessons or changes noticed.\n- Highlight progress, even if some numbers were modest or below goals.\n\nStep 4:\nCTA: “What’s your proudest milestone from the past year?”\n\nStep 5:\nStep 5A (Brainstorm hook angles): \n- [Numbers focus] “One year, a lot of experiments: here’s what the last 12 months looked like in numbers.”\n- [Personal recap] “Another trip around the sun—time for an honest recap.”\n- [Progress theme] “Measuring progress, one experiment at a time.”\n- [User’s phrasing] “Birthday post. Past year recap by the numbers.”\n\nStep 5B:\n- [Numbers] “X videos, Y newsletter subs, Z products shipped—here’s what really stands out.”\n- [Personal recap] “It’s easy to miss slow progress until you see it summed up.”\n- [Progress] “Not every ‘win’ makes a headline, but the totals tell a story.”\n- [User’s own] “Direct, factual—‘by the numbers’ moment.”\n\nStep 5C:\nChoose: [Numbers focus] + [Progress theme] — “A year in numbers: not flashy, but real.\"\n\nFinal hook: “12 months, a bunch of experiments, and plenty of lessons. Here’s my past year—by the numbers.”\n\nStep 6:\nDraft post:\n\n12 months, a bunch of experiments, and plenty of lessons. Here’s my past year—by the numbers.\n\n- [Your main metric #1] newsletter subscribers\n- [Your main metric #2] courses launched\n- [Your main metric #3] YouTube videos published\n- [Your main metric #4] products or projects shipped\n- [Other relevant metric(s)]\n\nSome of these numbers were higher than I expected. Others… a bit humbling.\n\nBut the big lesson? Progress compounds in small, consistent steps—and it’s only obvious when you look back.\n\nWhat’s your proudest milestone from the past year?\n\nStep 7:\nStyle review:\n- Factual, not motivational\n- No rhetorical questions to open\n- Approachable, honest, humble\n- Only one em dash. Numbers and lessons are easy to adjust with real data later.\n- Invitation is clear: “What’s your proudest milestone from the past year?”\n\nStep 8:\nWrite the final post.",
