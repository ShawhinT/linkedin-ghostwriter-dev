post-004,False,"Step 1: Summarize Shaw's style. Shaw's posts are factual, practical, and educational, often using clear lists or frameworks. He uses a hook-problem-solution structure, avoids idioms, motivational catchphrases, and business jargon, and ends with a factual engagement prompt. Playful metaphors are rare and original, not generic. He avoids summarizing tricolons and punchlines, and his posts do not have a generic motivational tone.

Step 2: Identify red flags. This post opens with a tricolon-style list in the first sentence (""12 months, a bunch of experiments, and plenty of lessons""), which is a persuasive tricolon. The phrase ""progress isn't always linear"" is a common motivational catchphrase. The sentence ""The real insight? Small, steady efforts add up more than you realize‚Äîespecially when you finally stop and measure"" is a summarizing, motivational punchline, not a factual engagement prompt. There is also a tricolon with negation (""add up more than you realize‚Äîespecially when you finally stop and measure""). The engagement prompt at the end is motivational and reflective, not factual.

Step 3: Weigh red flags against overall structure. The post is structured as a year-in-review, but it lacks a clear problem/observation and solution/resource breakdown. Instead, it focuses on summarizing lessons and motivation, which is not characteristic of Shaw's style. The use of tricolons, motivational language, and a summarizing punchline are all strong red flags.

Step 4: Cross-reference with examples. Shaw's posts do not use motivational punchlines or summarizing tricolons. His year-in-review or milestone posts are factual, break down numbers or steps, and end with a factual engagement prompt, not a motivational reflection.

Step 5: Final check. The post contains multiple major deviations: persuasive tricolons, motivational catchphrases, a summarizing punchline, and a non-factual engagement prompt. These collectively make the post not sound like Shaw Talebi."
post-008,True,"Step 1: Summarize Shaw's style from the examples. Shaw's posts are practical, educational, and structured, often using clear lists or frameworks. He avoids idioms, business clich√©s, and motivational catchphrases, and his posts typically follow a hook ‚Üí problem/observation ‚Üí solution/resource structure. He uses factual engagement prompts at the end, not motivational punchlines.

Step 2: Check for red flags. This post uses a list format, which is consistent with Shaw's style. The opener is factual and observational, and the post is divided into clear sections (Technical skills, Business & clients, Marketing & content, Mindset & growth). The language is mostly literal and practical. However, there are a few minor deviations:
- The phrase ‚Äúlook foolish (yep, it‚Äôs part of it)‚Äù is slightly more conversational than Shaw‚Äôs typical tone, but not a clich√© or idiom.
- The closing sentence, ‚ÄúBut every single one matters if you want to go beyond just ‚Äòhaving data skills.‚Äô‚Äù is a bit more summarizing and motivational than Shaw‚Äôs usual factual engagement prompt, but it is not a tricolon or overtly motivational punchline.
- The engagement prompt at the end is factual and in the correct place: ‚ÄúWhat did *you* have to learn that surprised you most?‚Äù

Step 3: Weigh red flags against overall structure and value. The post is practical, educational, and provides a clear breakdown of lessons learned. The minor conversational tone in one bullet and the slightly summarizing closing sentence do not significantly change the overall feel or clarity of the post. There are no idioms, business clich√©s, or overtly motivational phrases.

Step 4: Cross-reference with examples. Shaw‚Äôs posts sometimes include light humor or conversational asides (e.g., ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt be that impressive anyway üòÖ‚Äù), and he occasionally uses a summarizing sentence before the engagement prompt. The structure and tone here are consistent with those examples.

Step 5: Final cumulative check. There are no cumulative minor deviations that significantly change the tone or clarity. The post remains practical, educational, and on-brand overall.

Conclusion: The post sounds like Shaw, with only minor deviations that do not warrant a 'not Shaw' label."
post-009,True,"Step 1: Summarize Shaw's style from the examples. Shaw's posts are practical, educational, and structured with a clear hook, problem/observation, and solution/resource. He uses stepwise lists, avoids idioms and business jargon, and ends with a factual engagement prompt. Playful or light humor is rare but possible, and he uses 'e.g.' for examples.

Step 2: Check for red flags. The post opens with a factual, practical hook and frames the problem (ways to build side income without quitting a job). The list is clear, stepwise, and practical, with concrete examples and specific numbers. There are no idioms, business clich√©s, or motivational catchphrases. The engagement prompt is factual and at the end. There is no excessive use of rhetorical questions, tricolons, or asyndetic parallelism. Example formatting is consistent with Shaw's style (parentheses for platforms, not 'think:' or informal markers). No salesy or emotional appeals are present.

Step 3: Weigh red flags against overall structure. There are no significant or minor deviations from Shaw's style. The post is practical, educational, and follows the expected structure.

Step 4: Cross-reference with examples. Shaw has written similar posts with lists of opportunities, clear breakdowns, and factual engagement prompts. The tone, structure, and content are highly consistent with his style.

Step 5: Final check. The post provides clear value, follows the hook-problem-solution structure, and avoids all major and minor red flags. It is on-brand for Shaw Talebi."
post-005,False,"Step 1: Summarize Shaw's style from the examples. Shaw's posts are factual, practical, and educational, often using clear, stepwise lists or frameworks. His openers are factual, observational, or curiosity-driven, with rare playful metaphors or light humor. He follows a 3-part structure: hook ‚Üí problem/observation ‚Üí solution/resource. He avoids idioms, motivational catchphrases, business jargon, and summarizing tricolons. Engagement prompts are factual and at the end.

Step 2: Check for red flags. This post opens with a milestone announcement and a motivational framing ('the deeper reason I keep publishing has nothing to do with numbers'). It uses a summarizing tricolon punchline ('Milestones are fun, but the process‚Äîlearning alongside a growing community‚Äîkeeps me coming back.'), which is not characteristic of Shaw's style. The post is reflective and motivational, focusing on personal growth and fulfillment, which is not typical for Shaw, who usually provides practical, educational value or concrete frameworks. There is also a mild use of asyndetic parallelism with negation ('Milestones are fun, but the process... keeps me coming back.'). The engagement prompt is at the end, which is on-brand, but the overall tone is more motivational and reflective than Shaw's usual practical, educational style.

Step 3: Weigh red flags against overall structure. The post lacks a clear, stepwise breakdown or practical framework. It is more about personal motivation and reflection than providing actionable value or educational content. The use of a summarizing punchline and motivational tone are significant deviations from Shaw's style.

Step 4: Cross-reference with examples. Shaw's posts about milestones (e.g., income, content creation) are factual, break down the process, and focus on practical lessons or frameworks. This post is more reflective and motivational, lacking the practical, educational focus seen in Shaw's examples.

Step 5: Final check. The post contains multiple major deviations: motivational tone, summarizing punchline, lack of practical breakdown, and a focus on personal fulfillment rather than educational value. These collectively make the post not sound like Shaw."
post-002,False,"Step 1: Summarize Shaw's style. Shaw's posts are factual, practical, and educational, often using clear lists or frameworks. His openers are usually factual or observational, sometimes playful, but rarely motivational. He follows a hook ‚Üí problem/observation ‚Üí solution/resource structure, and closes with a factual engagement prompt. He avoids idioms, business clich√©s, and motivational punchlines.

Step 2: Check for red flags. 
- The opener is somewhat motivational: ""I left my job, failed for 15 months straight, and finally cracked $10k/month."" This is more dramatic than Shaw's typical factual or observational openers, but not egregiously so.
- The phrase ""create my own path"" is a mild idiom, but not a strong business clich√©. ""Failing forward"" is a common motivational phrase and is not typical of Shaw's style.
- The post uses a clear, stepwise breakdown of income sources, which is on-brand.
- The closing sentence is a motivational engagement prompt: ""What‚Äôs the one thing holding you back from starting your own project?"" This is more motivational and less factual than Shaw's typical engagement prompts, which usually ask for specific experiences or feedback.
- The post does not use tricolons, excessive rhetorical questions, or business jargon.

Step 3: Weigh red flags against overall structure. The post is practical and provides a clear breakdown, but the use of motivational language (""create my own path,"" ""failing forward,"" ""turning point"") and the motivational engagement prompt are notable deviations. The cumulative effect is a more inspirational, less factual tone than Shaw's typical posts.

Step 4: Cross-reference with examples. Shaw's actual post on this topic is more factual and less motivational, focusing on the reality of self-employment and ending with a factual statement about fulfillment, not a motivational question. The engagement prompt here is more generic and motivational than Shaw's usual style.

Step 5: Final check. There are two or more minor deviations (motivational opener, idiomatic/motivational phrases, motivational engagement prompt) that together shift the tone away from Shaw's practical, educational style. The overall feel is more inspirational and less factual/educational than Shaw's typical posts."
post-003,True,"Step 1: Summarize Shaw's style. Shaw's posts are practical, educational, and structured with a hook, problem/observation, and solution/resource. He avoids idioms, business jargon, and motivational punchlines, and typically ends with a factual engagement prompt. Resource announcements include a clear breakdown of what the resource covers, often in a bulleted or stepwise format.

Step 2: Check for red flags. This post opens with a factual observation (""Moving an ML model from your laptop to production can feel like a black box.""), which is consistent with Shaw's style. The post then announces a blog and provides a clear, stepwise breakdown of what the guide covers, using specific, literal language. There are no idioms, business jargon, or motivational phrases. The engagement prompt is factual and at the end. There is no excessive use of em-dashes, rhetorical questions, or tricolons. The example formatting is standard (""In this guide, I cover:""), which is consistent with Shaw's style.

Step 3: Weigh red flags against overall structure. There are no significant red flags. The post is practical, educational, and follows Shaw's typical structure for resource announcements.

Step 4: Cross-reference with examples. This post is very similar to Shaw's positive examples, especially those announcing resources or guides (e.g., the AI Agents course post). The structure, tone, and content are all consistent with Shaw's style.

Step 5: Final check. The post provides clear value, follows the hook-problem-solution structure, and ends with a factual engagement prompt. There are no cumulative minor deviations that would change the overall feel or clarity of the post.

Conclusion: The post sounds like Shaw Talebi."
post-001,True,"Step 1: Summarize Shaw's style. Shaw's posts are practical, educational, and structured with a clear hook, problem/observation, and solution/resource. He uses clear, literal language, stepwise lists, and factual engagement prompts. He avoids idioms, business jargon, motivational punchlines, and generic phrasing. Playful metaphors are rare and technical, not generic. 

Step 2: Check for red flags. The post starts with a slightly conversational opener (""feels overwhelming""), but this is factual and fits Shaw's style. The main body is a stepwise, numbered list of tools, each with a brief, practical explanation. The language is clear and literal (e.g., ""a must-have if you're on a Mac,"" ""My go-to package manager""). There are no idioms, business clich√©s, or motivational phrases. The closing sentence is a factual engagement prompt (""What's one tool you can't live without in your AI dev setup?""). There is no summarizing tricolon or punchline, and no excessive em-dash use (just one in the opener, which is acceptable). Example formatting is consistent with Shaw's style (numbered list, clear explanations). 

Step 3: Weigh red flags against overall structure. There are no major or minor deviations from Shaw's style. The post is practical, educational, and follows the hook-problem-solution structure. 

Step 4: Cross-reference with examples. This post is highly consistent with Shaw's positive examples, especially those that list tools or frameworks (e.g., the ""7 Basic AI Terms"" or ""25 AI Buzzwords"" posts). The engagement prompt is factual and at the end, matching Shaw's typical structure. 

Step 5: Final check. The post provides clear value, follows Shaw's structure, and contains no red flags. It sounds like Shaw Talebi."
post-006,False,"Step 1: Summarize Shaw's style. Shaw's posts are practical, educational, and structured, often using clear lists or frameworks. He avoids idioms, business clich√©s, and motivational punchlines, and typically ends with a factual engagement prompt. His examples use 'e.g.' and his tone is factual, sometimes lightly playful but not generic or motivational.

Step 2: Identify red flags. This post uses a clear, practical comparison between corporate and freelance data science, with bullet points for each. However, there are a few subtle red flags:
- The phrase 'Each has its tradeoffs‚Äîcorporate offers stability and specialization, freelance offers breadth and independence.' is a summarizing tricolon with a dash, which is not typical for Shaw (he avoids summarizing tricolons and punchlines).
- The use of 'You‚Äôre responsible for everything‚Äîscoping, delivery, and landing the next gig' is another tricolon with a dash, which is a persuasive structure Shaw avoids.
- The phrase 'Each has its tradeoffs' is a generic business phrase, bordering on clich√©.
- The post does not use 'e.g.' for examples, instead using informal bullet points.

Step 3: Weigh red flags against overall structure. The post is otherwise practical, educational, and follows a hook-problem-solution structure. The engagement prompt is factual and at the end. However, the use of two summarizing tricolons with dashes and a generic business phrase are significant style mismatches.

Step 4: Cross-reference with examples. Shaw's posts do not use summarizing tricolons or generic business phrases. His lists stand on their own, and he avoids punchline summaries. The negative examples in the guidelines specifically flag this kind of structure as off-brand.

Step 5: Final check. There are two or more minor deviations (summarizing tricolons, generic phrasing, informal example formatting), and together they change the overall feel of the post to be less in Shaw's style. The post is close, but the cumulative effect of these deviations makes it not sound like Shaw."
post-010,False,"Step 1: Summarize Shaw's style. Shaw's posts are practical, educational, and structured with a hook, problem/observation, and solution/resource. He avoids idioms, business jargon, and motivational punchlines, and typically ends with a factual engagement prompt. He uses clear, stepwise lists and provides context for why something matters.

Step 2: Identify red flags. This post contains several elements that are not characteristic of Shaw's style:
- The hook uses a dollar amount and a dash, which is more salesy and punchy than Shaw's typical factual or curiosity-driven openers.
- The list is practical, but the final bullet ('Kept it transparent‚Äîposting about real experiments, results, and behind-the-scenes lessons') uses an em-dash for emphasis, which is rare for Shaw (he typically uses parentheses or commas).
- The summarizing sentence ('The lesson: Cutting through the noise in 2024 means helping people just a step behind you‚Äîdocumenting what you try, what works, and what flops.') is a motivational punchline and uses a tricolon with asyndetic parallelism and an em-dash, which is not Shaw's style. Shaw avoids summarizing tricolons and punchlines, preferring to let the list stand on its own.
- The engagement prompt is at the end and factual, which is on-brand.

Step 3: Weigh red flags against overall structure. While the post is practical and includes a stepwise list, the presence of a summarizing punchline with a tricolon and em-dash, as well as a slightly salesy opener, are significant deviations from Shaw's style. The cumulative effect of these elements changes the tone from Shaw's typical educational and factual approach to something more motivational and punchy.

Step 4: Cross-reference with examples. Shaw's posts do not use summarizing tricolons or motivational punchlines, and his resource or revenue posts are more factual and less salesy. The negative examples in the instructions specifically flag this kind of closing structure and tone as not Shaw.

Step 5: Final check. The post contains more than one minor deviation (salesy opener, summarizing punchline, em-dash, tricolon), which together make it not sound like Shaw. The overall feel is less educational and more motivational/persuasive than Shaw's typical style."
post-007,True,"Step 1: Summarize Shaw's style from the examples. Shaw's posts are practical, educational, and structured, often using lists or frameworks. He uses clear, literal language, avoids idioms and business clich√©s, and typically follows a hook ‚Üí problem/observation ‚Üí solution/resource structure. His engagement prompts are factual and at the end.

Step 2: Check for red flags. This post opens with a factual observation, then provides a clear, stepwise list of non-technical skills. The language is literal and practical, with no idioms, business clich√©s, or motivational catchphrases. The list is formatted in Shaw's typical style, and the closing sentence is a factual engagement prompt. There is one parenthetical aside (""yes, you can‚Äôt avoid this""), but this is consistent with Shaw's occasional use of light, conversational asides. The phrase ""simplicity > design"" is a literal comparison, not an idiom or clich√©. The phrase ""words matter, maybe more than code"" is also literal and not a motivational punchline.

Step 3: Weigh red flags against overall structure. There are no significant red flags. The post is practical, educational, and follows Shaw's typical structure. The engagement prompt is factual and at the end.

Step 4: Cross-reference with examples. Shaw has several posts that use similar list structures, parenthetical asides, and factual engagement prompts. The tone and structure are highly consistent with his style.

Step 5: Final check. The post provides clear value, follows the expected structure, and contains no idioms, clich√©s, or business jargon. There are no cumulative minor deviations that would change the overall feel or clarity of the post."
