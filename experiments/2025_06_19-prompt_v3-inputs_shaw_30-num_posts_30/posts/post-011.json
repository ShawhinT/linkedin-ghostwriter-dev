  "writing_steps": "**Step 1: Purpose & Audience**\n- Purpose: Educate—clarify the terminology confusion around \"AI\" and introduce a structured way to think about different generations of software (1.0, 2.0, 3.0).\n- Audience: Broad LinkedIn tech and business audience—aspiring AI practitioners, engineers, product folks, and non-technical professionals trying to understand the space.\n\n**Step 2: Wireframe**\n[Hook]\n“AI” means something wildly different depending on who you ask.\n\n[Meat]\n- Introduce the idea that software has evolved through three big “waves.”\n- List Software 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 with a quick explanation for each.\n- Briefly summarize why this matters (confusion, job roles, products, clarity).\n\n[CTA]\nAsk: How do you define “AI” in your world?\n\n**Step 3: Write the body (“meat”):**\nWhen someone says “AI,” they might be picturing completely different things:\n\nHere’s a simple breakdown of 3 types of software I find helpful:\n\n- Software 1.0 = Rule-based systems\n  - Think: If-then-else rules, hardcoded logic, business rules\n- Software 2.0 = ML-based systems\n  - Think: Models trained with labeled data—like image classifiers or fraud detection\n- Software 3.0 = LLMs\n  - Think: Systems powered by large language models (GPT-4, Claude) that can reason, generate, and follow instructions\n\nMost of the confusion comes because people mix these up—or just use “AI” to mean anything smarter than a spreadsheet.\n\n**Step 4: CTA or question**\nHow do you define “AI” in your world?\n\n**Step 5: Hooks (labeled directions with notes)**\n1. [Problem/solution] “AI” confusion — Most people mean different things\n    - Focus: calling out confusion, promise a framework\n2. [Trend/urgency] The evolution of “software”—from rules to LLMs\n    - Focus: fast transition, what each era means\n3. [Beginner/clarity] Quick primer: 3 meanings of “AI”\n    - Focus: set clear expectations, educate newcomers\n4. [User original phrasing] “A problem with AI today is that it means different things to different people.”\n\nDecision: #1 is the strongest (resonates with broad pain point), boosted by some language from the original phrasing. \n\n**Step 6: Full Draft**\n“AI” means something wildly different depending on who you ask.\n\nAfter working in the field and talking with folks from different backgrounds, I find it useful to break software into three types:\n\n- Software 1.0 = Rule-based systems (think: if-then rules, hardcoded logic)\n- Software 2.0 = ML-based systems (think: models trained on data)\n- Software 3.0 = LLMs (think: GPT-4, Claude… models that generate, reason, and adapt in real-time)\n\nMost of the confusion around “AI” happens because these lines get blurred.\n\nA good first step is just agreeing on which “generation” of software you’re actually talking about.\n\nHow do you define “AI” in your world?\n\n**Step 7: Review for voice and style**\n- Clear, educational tone with factual framing\n- No motivational language, rhetorical openers, or tricolon negation\n- Bullets for clarity, brief context for each wave\n- Simple invitation to share perspectives\n- Em dash audit: Does not use more than one (none in this case)\n- Phrase variety in hook and body\n\n**Step 8: Write final post**",
  "final_post": "“AI” means something wildly different depending on who you ask.\n\nHere’s a simple breakdown I find helpful for making sense of all the hype and confusion:\n\n- **Software 1.0:** Rule-based systems  \n  If-then rules, hardcoded logic, business rules\n- **Software 2.0:** ML-based systems  \n  Models trained on labeled data—think image classifiers or fraud detection\n- **Software 3.0:** LLMs  \n  Large language models like GPT-4 and Claude that generate, reason, and adapt in real time\n\nA lot of the noise around “AI” is just people talking past each other—using the same word for wildly different things. Getting clear about which type of software you’re discussing is the first step to productive conversations (and better products).\n\nHow do you define “AI” in your world?"
