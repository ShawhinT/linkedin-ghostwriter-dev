  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Educate (showing different monetization paths for AI skills)\n- Audience: AI practitioners, learners, and those curious about professional applications of AI skills (both early professionals and those looking to branch out).\n\nStep 2: Post Wireframe\n- Hook\n- The 5 ways (clear breakdown with a quick explanation for each)\n- Question to spark discussion\n\nStep 3: The Meat\n\nIf you have AI skills, you don’t have to just pick the traditional path. Here are 5 ways to make money with your AI abilities:\n\n1. Get a job. The classic approach: join a company as an ML engineer, data scientist, or AI product owner.\n2. Implementation. Freelance or contract building solutions for businesses—often, companies need hands-on help making models or integrating APIs.\n3. Strategy/consulting. Guide companies or founders on *what* to automate, *which* tools to use, and how to measure results.\n4. Education. Teach others—whether through online courses, workshops, YouTube, or cohort-based programs.\n5. Product. Build your own AI-powered SaaS, app, or digital tool. This is higher risk, but the upside can be meaningful if you solve a real pain point.\n\nStep 4: CTA/Question\nWhich path are you most interested in—or have already tried?\n\nFilter: According to guidelines, I must choose only one. Best is: Which path are you most interested in?\n\nStep 5: Hook brainstorming\nStep 5A – Labeled directions and notes\n- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “Most people think you need a PhD or a big company job to profit from AI…”\n- [List/Numbers] “5 ways to actually monetize your AI skills (that aren’t limited to 9-5 jobs)”\n- [Trend/urgency] “AI jobs are just one way to earn. Here are 4 others you might not have considered.”\n- [Personal language] “If you know AI, you’ve got options. Here are 5 ways to put those skills to work.”\n- [User’s phrasing] “5 ways to make money with your AI skills”\n\nStep 5B – Notes\n- “5 ways” frames the post as actionable, clear, and practical for a wide audience.\n- ‘Beginner-to-expert’ helps people feel included, without overwhelming them.\n- ‘Options/choices’ resonates with folks who want agency in their careers.\n\nStep 5C – Choose strongest: Go with a combo of number/list for clarity and user phrasing for relevance.\n\nFinal Hook: “There’s more than one way to profit from your AI skills.”\n\nStep 6: Draft of Full Post\nThere’s more than one way to profit from your AI skills.\n\nIf you’re looking to make a living (or side income) with what you know, here are five paths you can take:\n\n1. Get a job. Join a company as an ML engineer, data scientist, or AI product owner.\n2. Implementation. Offer freelance or contract services to build solutions—plenty of businesses are looking for hands-on help.\n3. Strategy/consulting. Help founders and teams figure out *what* to automate and *how* to choose the right tools.\n4. Education. Teach—through online courses, coaching, or making content for learners hungry for clarity.\n5. Product. Build your own SaaS, app, or digital tool using your AI knowledge. It’s riskier, but the upside can be big if you solve a real pain point.\n\nWhich path are you most interested in?\n\nStep 7: Style, Voice, and Flow Review\n- Tone is direct, factual, and conversational.\n- No motivational language or tricolons with negation.\n- One em dash found (in “hands-on help”)—acceptable here.\n- Only one CTA.\n- White space and lists used.\n- Matches provided examples: steers clear of describing personal experience, stays broad and educational.\n\nStep 8: Final Post",
