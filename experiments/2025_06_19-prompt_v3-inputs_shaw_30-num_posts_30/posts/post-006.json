  "writing_steps": "Step 1:\n- Purpose: Share Shaw's personal journey and lessons learned from reaching $70k (likely revenue/earning milestone). This is to educate and inspire others on a similar path, while being transparent.\n- Target audience: Fellow entrepreneurs, aspiring solopreneurs, freelancers, AI educators—anyone looking to build/grow their own business.\n\nStep 2 (Wireframe):\n[Hook: Sets the stage for a personal, transparent financial milestone]\n[Body: Key lessons learned along the way (bulleted or numbered for clarity)]\n[CTA: Invitation for readers to share their own lessons or ask about a specific detail]\n\nStep 3 (Body - Meat):\nMaking it to $70k hasn’t been a linear path. Most of what I thought would work didn’t—and the lessons were rarely obvious at first.\n\nHere are the key takeaways from this journey:\n\n1. Stay consistent: The biggest leaps happened after long periods of “slow growth.” Show up, even when things look flat.\n2. Focus on problems, not just tech: Building things people want is more important than building with the “latest and greatest” tech.\n3. Diversify your learning: Most breakthroughs happened after I learned from people outside my own niche—don’t be afraid to steal ideas from other industries.\n4. Track what matters: Numbers can motivate, but it’s easy to chase the wrong metrics. Define your own version of “success” early.\n\nEach phase came with its own challenge. Nothing was guaranteed, and most of it looked uncertain until it was directly behind me.\n\nStep 4 (CTA):\nWhat’s one lesson you’ve learned on your own journey?\n\nStep 5 (Hook Directions):\n1. [User’s phrasing] My Journey from 0 to 70k (key lessons)\n- Transparent, straightforward, signals summary/reflection\n2. [Personal story] \"Most people only see the result—not the lessons behind it.\"\n- Invitation to “see behind the curtain”\n3. [Results/outcome] How I went from 0 to $70k (the honest version)\n- Teasing results but promising honest, unvarnished takeaways\n4. [Problem/solution] “Everyone talks about the wins. Here’s what actually mattered during my journey from 0 to $70k.”\n- Focusing on lessons, not just the finish line\n\nStep 5B:\n- Phrases: “What I wish I knew at $0” “Not a straight line” “Key lessons looking back”\n\nStep 5C:\nPick the transparent, direct hook—mirrors user phrasing, clarifies this is a reflection, and fits Shaw’s voice.\n\nStep 6 (Full Post Draft):\nMy journey from $0 to $70k: the key lessons\n\nMaking it to $70k hasn’t been a straight line. Most of what I thought would work didn’t—and the biggest lessons were rarely clear at the start.\n\nHere are my biggest takeaways from the journey so far:\n\n1. Stay consistent. Most of my breakthroughs came after long periods with almost no visible progress. Showing up each day matters more than “hustling hard” in spurts.\n2. Focus on solving real problems, not just playing with the newest tech. Most of the value comes from building something people care about.\n3. Learn from outside your bubble. My biggest growth often came from studying people outside my niche. Don’t be afraid to remix ideas that work elsewhere.\n4. Track your own numbers—not someone else’s. It’s easy to get distracted by vanity metrics. Define what success means to you and measure that.\n\nEach stage brought new challenges. Nothing felt certain in the moment, and most wins weren’t obvious until I looked back.\n\nWhat’s one lesson you’ve learned on your own journey?\n\nStep 7 (Review for style, voice, and flow):\n- Consistent with Shaw’s other milestone posts (see SaaS entrepreneur/1st customer example)\n- Tone is factual, honest, not motivational—direct and transparent.\n- Only a single em dash in the body (acceptable, fits style)\n- No fabricated details or false specificity\n- Ends with a single, clear question\n\nStep 8: Write the final post.",
