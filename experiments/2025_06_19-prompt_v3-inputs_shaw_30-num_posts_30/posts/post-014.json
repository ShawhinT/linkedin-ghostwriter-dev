  "writing_steps": "**Step 1: Purpose & Audience**\n- Purpose: Share original video content about fine-tuning LLMs (Large Language Models) using MLX. The goal is to educate and drive traffic to the video while validating interest.\n- Audience: AI engineers, learners interested in AI/LLM tooling, and entrepreneurs experimenting with fine-tuning.\n\n**Step 2: Wireframe**\n- Hook: Tease a fresh, actionable resource for fine-tuning LLMs with MLX\n- Meat: Brief context of why this is useful or timely; highlight what's covered without assuming specifics; explain who it helps\n- Link: Paste video link\n- CTA: Ask one focused question to spark discussion\n\n**Step 3: Write the Body**\nFine-tuning large language models is more accessible than ever, but the explosion of new tools makes it confusing to choose the right stack. MLX is one of the more promising frameworks for training and fine-tuning LLMs, so I put together a video walking through the basics.\n\nWhether you’re looking to run experiments on your own data or just want a practical look at fine-tuning workflows with modern tools, these are the essentials to know.\n\n**Step 4: CTA/Question**\nWhat tooling have you tried for fine-tuning LLMs?\n\n**Step 5: Hook Exploration**\nA) [Practical resource] \"Fine-tuning LLMs is easier than ever—here’s how to do it with MLX.\"\nB) [Beginner help] \"Not sure how to get started with LLM fine-tuning? This walkthrough with MLX will help.\"\nC) [Trend/urgency] \"MLX is a rapidly growing fine-tuning toolkit—see it in action.\"\nD) [Result-tease] \"Tried MLX for LLM fine-tuning? Here’s my hands-on overview.\"\nE) [User’s own phrasing] Simple, direct: \"Fine-tuning LLMs with MLX.\"\n\nShort notes: Options A/C have the most focus on action and trends. B is beginner-focused; D teases hands-on perspective; E is direct but plain.\n\n**Choose strongest:** A is concise and action-oriented. Will use as basis.\n\n**Step 6: Draft Full Post**\nFine-tuning LLMs is easier than ever—here’s how to do it with MLX.\n\nFine-tuning large language models used to require setting up obscure dependencies and wrangling GPU configs for hours, but new toolkits are lowering that barrier.\n\nMLX is one of the most promising frameworks to enter the scene, so I recorded a walkthrough on the basics:\n\n[link to video]\n\nIf you’re experimenting with LLMs or just want to see what’s possible with MLX, this should give you a practical head start.\n\nWhat tooling have you tried for fine-tuning LLMs?\n\n**Step 7: Review for Style, Voice, and Flow**\n- Tone: Approachable, practical, points to hands-on use\n- No rhetorical question opener, no tricolons with negation\n- Bullet/white space used\n- CTA single and clear\n- Link before CTA\n\n**Step 8: Write Final Post**",
  "final_post": "Fine-tuning LLMs is easier than ever—here’s how to do it with MLX.\n\nFine-tuning large language models used to mean wrangling complex dependencies and GPU configs for hours. Now, new toolkits are making that process much more accessible.\n\nMLX is one of the most promising frameworks I’ve seen, so I recorded a walkthrough on the basics:\n\n▶️ [Video: Fine-tuning LLMs with MLX]\n\nIf you’re trying to experiment or deploy custom models, this should help you get started with minimal friction.\n\nWhat tooling have you tried for fine-tuning LLMs?"
