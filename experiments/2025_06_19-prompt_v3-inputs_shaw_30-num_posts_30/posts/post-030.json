  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose and Audience\n- Purpose: Share a new blog post about multimodal embeddings, likely to educate and drive traffic to the blog.\n- Audience: AI practitioners, ML engineers, students, and others interested in advanced AI concepts.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n[Hook: Engage readers with curiosity about multimodal embeddings]\n[Brief description of what multimodal embeddings are, and why they matter]\n[Link to the blog post]\n[CTA: Ask for feedback or invite discussion]\n\nStep 3: Body (“Meat”)\n- Multimodal embeddings map different data types (text, images, audio) into a shared space, enabling joint reasoning.\n- They're the backbone of many recent advances in AI: think image-captioning, search, and generative multimodal models.\n- Explain in 1–2 lines why this is timely or useful.\n\nStep 4: CTA/Question\n- What’s one application of multimodal embeddings you find most exciting?\n\nStep 5A: Brainstorm Hook Directions\n1. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “Ever wondered how AI connects images, text, and audio?”\n2. [Trend/urgency] \"Multimodal embeddings are powering the next generation of AI apps.\"\n3. [User’s phrasing] “Sharing my latest blog on multimodal embeddings”\n4. [Problem/Solution] \"Confused by all the buzz around 'multimodal'? Here's a breakdown.\"\n5. [Application angle] \"If you’ve used AI that understands both images and text, you’ve used multimodal embeddings.\"\n\nStep 5B: Add Notes\n1. For beginners, explain why mapping different kinds of data together matters.\n2. Tie to current AI trends (e.g., image+text generation, retrieval).\n3. Simple, direct (good for familiar audience).\n4. Educational angle, demystifying jargon.\n5. Connect to practical, well-known use cases.\n\nStep 5C: Choose the strongest angle: #1 (Beginner-to-expert clarity: “Ever wondered how AI connects images, text, and audio?”)\n\nStep 6: Draft\nEver wondered how AI connects images, text, and audio?\n\nThe answer: multimodal embeddings.\n\nThese techniques map multiple types of data into a shared space, allowing models to \"reason\" across them. That’s how you get things like image search, captioning, or generating text from photos.\n\nI’ve broken down the basics (plus use cases and why it matters) in a quick new blog post:\n\n[link]\n\nWhat’s one application of multimodal embeddings you find most exciting?\n\nStep 7: Review\n- Clarity: strong, technical-but-accessible\n- Scannability: short intro, clear bullets\n- Voice: approachable, transparent, lightly educational\n- No em dash overflow\n- Consistent with Shaw’s style\n\nStep 8: Final Post",
  "final_post": "Ever wondered how AI connects images, text, and audio?\n\nThe answer: multimodal embeddings.\n\nThis approach maps different types of data—like text, images, and sound—into a shared space, so models can reason across them. That’s how we get things like image search, captioning, and apps that generate stories from your photos.\n\nI put together a simple overview (with use cases) on my blog:\n\n[link]\n\nWhat’s one application of multimodal embeddings you find most exciting?"
