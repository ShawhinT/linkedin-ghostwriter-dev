  "writing_steps": "**Step 1: Purpose & Audience**\n- Purpose: Share content; specifically, share a blog post about fine-tuning BERT for text classification.\n- Audience: Potential students, AI practitioners, or anyone interested in NLP and hands-on technical guides.\n\n**Step 2: Wireframe**\n- Hook: Highlight BERT's impact in NLP and fine-tuning value, or a practical angle for readers interested in hands-on AI.\n- Meat: Briefly mention what the blog covers (fine-tuning BERT for text classification) and who it’s for.\n- CTA: Prompt readers to check out the blog or ask their current text classification challenge.\n\n**Step 3: Body/Meat**\nIf you’ve been wanting to move beyond zero-shot or few-shot approaches and really squeeze the most out of pre-trained models, my latest blog should help. I break down the process of fine-tuning BERT specifically for text classification, with a walkthrough for those looking to upgrade their NLP pipelines.\n\n**Step 4: CTA**\nWhat’s your current hurdle with text classification projects?\n\n**Step 5A: Possible Hook Directions**\n1. [Problem/solution] \"Fed up with mediocre text classification results?\"\n2. [Action/result] \"Fine-tuned BERT models can boost text classification accuracy.\"\n3. [User’s own phrasing/straight] \"Fine-tuning BERT for text classification—step-by-step guide.\"\n4. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] \"Most tutorials stop at plug-and-play, but real gains come from fine-tuning.\"\n5. [Trend/urgency] \"If you’re still using off-the-shelf BERT, here’s how to take it further.\"\n\n**Step 5B: Flesh Out Directions**\n1. \"Are you tired of your model plateauing in performance? This guide can help.\"\n2. \"Learn how to fine-tune BERT for real improvements in your text classifiers.\"\n3. \"My new blog covers every step from dataset prep to evaluation.\"\n4. \"Unlock more from BERT by actually fine-tuning for your dataset.\"\n5. \"Move beyond defaults—up your NLP game.\"\n\n**Step 5C: Best Hook**\nI’ll pick direction #4: beginner-to-expert clarity.\n- Hook: \"Most tutorials stop at plug-and-play, but real gains come from fine-tuning.\"\n\n**Step 6: Draft Full Post**\nMost tutorials stop at plug-and-play, but real gains come from fine-tuning.\n\nIf you’ve been wanting to move beyond zero-shot or few-shot approaches and really squeeze the most out of pre-trained models, my latest blog should help. I break down the process of fine-tuning BERT specifically for text classification, with a walkthrough for those looking to upgrade their NLP pipelines.\n\nCheck out the full post here: [BLOG LINK]\n\nWhat’s your current hurdle with text classification projects?\n\n**Step 7: Style, Voice, & Flow Review**\n- Tone is practical, concise, and encouraging.\n- No assumption about results; just an honest share and invitation.\n- White space is included for scannability.\n- Voice is aligned with previous example posts.\n\n**Step 8: Final Post**",
