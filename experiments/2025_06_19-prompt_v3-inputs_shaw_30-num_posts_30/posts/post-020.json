No one cares about your background if you don’t solve a real problem.\n- Price for value—not your time. The market rewards results, not effort.\n- Higher price tags require longer copy. Take time to build trust before you make the ask.\n- Dial in your avatar, then attract them with valuable free content.\n- The real gap between $10k and $100k/mo? It’s business strategy, not technical skills.\n\nStep 4:\nCTA: Which of these stood out to you?\n\nStep 5:\n5A — Brainstorm hook angles:\n[User’s own phrasing] “I paid a $100k/mo entrepreneur to talk to me… here’s what I learned.”\n[Problem/solution] “Stuck at $10k/month? The missing piece isn’t more skills.”\n[Personal story] “Paying for advice felt risky, but it paid off faster than any tool I’ve bought.”\n[Outcome comparison] “What separates $10k/mo from $100k/mo? It’s never what you think.”\n[Beginner-to-expert clarity] “Most of us get stuck on tech.

You need longer copy—trust takes time, so don’t rush the ask.\n- Get laser clear on your target customer (avatar). Attract the right ones by sharing high-value free content.\n- The difference between $10k/mo and $100k/mo isn’t more technical skill—it’s business strategy.\n\nWhich of these stood out to you?\n\nStep 7:\n- One em dash, justified by hook style.\n- Repeated words/phrases: none in hook/first lines.\n- Hook is not restated in the body.\n- No specifics assumed beyond user notes.\n- Cleared for white space, bullets, flow.\n- Tone and structure fit example posts—direct, practical, and experience-based.\n\nStep 8:\nFinal post:",
