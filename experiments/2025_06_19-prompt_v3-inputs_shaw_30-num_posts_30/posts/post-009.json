  "writing_steps": "Step 1:\n- Purpose: Educate and promote a free guide to 30 actionable AI project ideas.\n- Target audience: Aspiring AI devs, learners, solopreneurs—anyone eager to build practical projects without high barriers.\n\nStep 2:\nWireframe:\n- [Hook: Bold claim or intriguing outcome for the reader.]\n- [Body: What’s in the guide and why it’s relevant. Discuss types of projects within the 3 levels.]\n- [Link to guide.]\n- [CTA: Ask which area people are most interested in or which project they’ll try first.]\n\nStep 3:\nBody:\n\nThe AI space is moving fast, but hands-on projects are still the best way to learn the real-world skills that matter. \n\nI put together a free guide with 30 project ideas across three levels:\n\n- Software 1.0: Data pipelines, analysis tools, and dashboards.\n- Software 2.0: Build custom ML models or deploy open-source ones.\n- Software 3.0: Prompt engineering, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), AI agents, and fine-tuning LLMs.\n\nThese cover a range of difficulty—from basic data tasks to novel agent-based systems—so you can pick one that fits your current level (and stretch a bit further if you want!).\n\nGrab the free guide here: [Insert link]\n\nStep 4:\nCTA: Which level of projects are you most interested in building right now?\n\nStep 5:\nHook brainstorm directions:\n1. [User’s phrasing]: 30 AI Projects You Can Build This Weekend (Free Guide)\n2. [Numbers/outcomes]: Build your first (or next) AI project—no matter your skill level\n3. [Problem/solution]: Feeling overwhelmed by all the ways to “learn AI”? Here’s a clear, actionable list\n4. [Beginner-expert clarity]: From dashboards to custom agents—a spectrum of hands-on AI projects for any builder\n\nNotes:\n- The user’s phrasing is direct and has urgency.\n- “No matter your skill level” reframes the list as accessible.\n- “Feeling overwhelmed” humanizes the pain point for AI learners.\n- “Spectrum” invokes range from fundamentals to advanced.\n\nPick strongest: The user’s own phrasing is strong, but adding the skill-level angle may make it more inviting and connect to the “three levels” body. So:\n\nFinal hook: 30 AI projects you can build this weekend (free guide for every skill level)\n\nStep 6:\nDraft of full post:\n\n30 AI projects you can build this weekend (free guide for every skill level)\n\nThe fastest way to learn AI is to get your hands dirty with real projects.\n\nI put together a free guide with 30 project ideas, covering:\n\n- Software 1.0: Data pipelines, analysis tools, dashboards\n- Software 2.0: Training or deploying machine learning models\n- Software 3.0: Prompt engineering, RAG, agents, and fine-tuning\n\nWhether you’re just starting or looking to try advanced systems, you’ll find something actionable here.\n\nDownload the free guide: [Insert link]\n\nWhich level are you most interested in building right now?\n\nStep 7:\nFinal Em Dash Audit: None used.\nNo repeated numbers, no rhetorical opener.
