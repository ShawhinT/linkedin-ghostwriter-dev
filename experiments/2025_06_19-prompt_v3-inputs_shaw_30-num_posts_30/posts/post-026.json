  "input": "Share blog: Local LLM fine-tuning on Mac\n\nContext:\nThis article is part of a larger series on using large language models (LLMs) in practice. In a previous post, I showed how to fine-tune an LLM using a single (free) GPU on Google Colab. While that example (and many others) readily runs on Nvidia hardware, they are not easily adapted to M-series Macs. In this article, I walk through an easy way to fine-tune an LLM locally on a Mac.",
  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose and Target Audience\n- Purpose: Share a new blog post and provide useful, actionable insights for those working with LLMs on Mac. Signal a practical solution to a known limitation.\n- Audience: AI practitioners, technical learners, Mac users interested in practical LLM workflows, readers following Shaw's series.\n\nStep 2: Post Wireframe\n[Hook about the gap for M-series Mac users with LLM fine-tuning]\n[Quick mention of previous Colab/Nvidia workflows and why that didn’t translate well to Mac]\n[Introduce new blog post and what it covers (fine-tuning LLMs on Mac)]\n[Link to the blog]\n[Question: inviting readers to share their Mac + LLM experiences]\n\nStep 3: Body/Meat\nMany tutorials for LLM fine-tuning (including my last post!) assume Nvidia hardware or the cloud, not local Mac setups. But lots of folks, myself included, want to experiment on Apple Silicon machines. In this new blog post, I walk through a simple setup for fine-tuning an LLM locally on Mac. It’s part of a step-by-step series for working with LLMs in the real world.\n\nStep 4: CTA/Question\nHave you tried running or fine-tuning LLMs on Mac? Would love to hear what’s worked (or not) for you.\n\nStep 5A: Brainstorm Hook Directions\n- [Gap/underdog angle] \"Most LLM tutorials don’t work on Mac. Here’s a fix.\"\n- [Trend/urgency] \"M-series Macs are everywhere, but most LLM guides ignore them.\"\n- [Problem/solution] \"Ever get stuck trying to run LLM fine-tuning on your Mac? You’re not alone.\"\n- [Series continuity] \"Continuing my series on practical LLM workflows, here’s how to do local fine-tuning on Mac.\"\n- [User’s own phrasing] None especially hooky in user’s input; body is more factual.\n\nStep 5B: Add notes to each\n- [Gap/underdog] Point out lack of resources, personal frustration\n- [Trend/urgency] “Mac is now a common dev machine, why are guides still Nvidia-first?”\n- [Problem/solution] Empathetic: calling to Mac LLM experimenters\n- [Series continuity] Positioning for returning readers/followers\n\nStep 5C: Choose and write actual hook\n\"Most LLM fine-tuning tutorials assume you’re on Nvidia—but what if you’re on a Mac?\"\n\nStep 6: Draft Full Post\nMost LLM fine-tuning tutorials assume you’re on Nvidia—but what if you’re on a Mac?\n\nIn my last post, I broke down LLM fine-tuning using a (free) GPU on Google Colab—a workflow that works great if you’re in the cloud, or on Nvidia hardware. But if you’re experimenting locally on an M-series Mac, those steps don’t always translate.\n\nSo I put together a new blog post showing a straightforward way to fine-tune LLMs directly on Mac. This is part of my broader series on practical LLM workflows, tackling the real-world roadblocks that come up.\n\nRead the blog here: [link]\n\nHave you tried running or fine-tuning LLMs on Mac? Curious what’s worked (or hasn’t) for you.\n\nStep 7: Review for Style, Voice, Flow\n- No rhetorical openers, motivational challenge, or tricolons\n- Factual and helpful, points to practical problem and solution\n- Asks only one clear question at the end\n- Follows white space and formatting guidance\n\nStep 8: Final Post",
