  "writing_steps": "**Step 1: Purpose and Audience**\n- Purpose: Encourage readers (likely aspiring AI engineers, entrepreneurs, and technical peers) that they don't need to be super-geniuses to build in AI, and highlight that action (building) is the real differentiator.\n- Target Audience: Aspiring AI engineers, technical creators, solopreneurs, students who might feel intimidated by the gap between themselves and 'top' people in the field.\n\n**Step 2: Post Wireframe**\n[Strong opening hook challenging the myth of intelligence as the differentiator]\n\n[Body: The single habit of building as key differentiator, demystify what 'top talent' really do differently, encourage specificity or small projects, maybe a bullet list of ways to \"just build\"]\n\n[Focused CTA: What’s the project you wish you’d just build already?]\n\n**Step 3: Body**\nMost people overestimate how much innate talent matters in AI engineering. But having spent time around top AI engineers, here’s what I’ve noticed:\n\n- They ship lots of projects (even small ones)\n- They learn by doing, not just by watching or reading\n- When they get stuck, they treat it as part of the process—not a sign they're not smart enough\n\nEach project—no matter how small—teaches more than a week of passively consuming tutorials.\n\nIf you’re hesitating to start because you think you “aren’t ready” or “aren’t smart enough,” just start building. The gap gets smaller every time you do.\n\n**Step 4: CTA or Question**\nWhat’s the project you wish you’d just build already?\n\n**Step 5: Hooks (Brainstorming directions and notes)**\n1. [User's own phrasing] \"Most top AI engineers aren’t more intelligent than you. They just do this one thing more... BUILD.\"\n2. [Misconception call-out] \"Intelligence isn’t what sets top engineers apart—action is.\"\n3. [Personal observation] \"Every top AI engineer I know does this differently: they build, early and often.\"\n4. [Problem/solution] \"Stuck watching tutorials? Here’s the truth about getting good at AI engineering.\"\n5. [Numbers] \"3 ways to learn faster than 99% of aspiring AI engineers (spoiler: it isn’t talent)\"\n\n**Step 5B: Add notes**\n- 1: Direct, addresses the reader.\n- 2: Myths about talent vs. action.\n- 3: Observational, may invoke credibility.\n- 4: Addresses passive learning trap.\n- 5: Could segue into a list, but user wants a clear, concise statement.\n\n**Step 5C: Choose strongest hook direction**\nI’ll use [User's own phrasing]—it’s clear, strong, and directly addresses the user’s intended message.\n\n**Step 6: Write Full Draft**\nMost top AI engineers aren’t more intelligent than you. They just do this one thing more... BUILD.\n\nMost people overestimate how much innate talent matters in AI engineering. But after spending time around top AI engineers, here’s what I’ve noticed:\n\n- They ship lots of projects (even small ones)\n- They learn by doing, not just by watching or reading\n- When they get stuck, they treat it as part of the process—not a sign they're not smart enough\n\nEach project—no matter how small—teaches more than a week of passively consuming tutorials.\n\nIf you’re hesitating to start because you think you “aren’t ready” or “aren’t smart enough,” just start building. The gap gets smaller every time you do.\n\nWhat’s the project you wish you’d just build already?\n\n**Step 7: Review for Style, Voice, and Flow**\n- Clean, factual, educational\n- No hype or rhetorical questions\n- Clear bullet points for scannability\n- Accurate to user’s idea\n- Friendly, peer-mentor tone\n\n**Step 8: Final Post**",
