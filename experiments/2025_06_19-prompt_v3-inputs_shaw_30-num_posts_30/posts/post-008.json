  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Celebrate milestone and share reflections, validate content journey, inspire/thank audience, maybe share lesson/next steps\n- Audience: Existing YouTube subscribers, broader content creators/entrepreneurs/influencers in Shaw’s network\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n[Hook: Call out 50k milestone, something about journey, maybe a lesson/stat] \n[Body: Briefly share what hitting 50k means, quick reflection on the journey, if any mistakes/lessons, thank audience, hint at what’s next]  \n[CTA: Ask audience their own milestone, or what they want to see next, or what helped them grow]\n\nStep 3: Body/Meat\n- Reaching 50,000 subs was not overnight\n- Started small—probably had doubts/challenges along the way\n- Consistency is the biggest unlock: I kept showing up, learning what works\n- Most important lesson: Don’t wait for perfection; publish and learn\n- Thank you to everyone who watched, commented, and shared\n- Excited for what’s next for the channel\n\nStep 4: CTA/Question\n- What’s a milestone you’re working toward right now?\n\nStep 5: Hooks (Brainstorm Directions)\nA. [Milestone Stat] “50,000 people now watch my YouTube channel. Still feels surreal.”\nB. [Personal Growth] “From 0 to 50,000 subs—here’s my single biggest lesson so far.”\nC. [Community Gratitude] “50,000 subscribers—thank you to every one of you who has been part of this journey.”\nD. [User’s Phrasing] “50k subs YouTube milestone” (as a direct statement)\nE. [Behind the Scenes] “What nobody tells you about hitting 50,000 YouTube subscribers.”\n\nStep 5B: Add notes\nA. [Milestone Stat]—Direct, feels honest, scannable\nB. [Personal Growth]—Useful, but only reference the journey if enough detail\nC. [Community Gratitude]—Simple gratitude, fits existing posts\nD. [Direct]—Could work if stylized as understated accomplishment\nE. [BTS]—Probably overreaching; stick to provided facts\n\nStep 5C: Pick strongest direction\nDirection A fits best, as it clearly marks the achievement and feels celebratory but factual (Shaw rarely uses overtly emotional or dramatic hooks). Could combine with C.\n\nFinal Hook:\n50,000 people now watch my YouTube channel. Still feels surreal.\n\nStep 6: Draft full post\n50,000 people now watch my YouTube channel. Still feels surreal.\n\nWhen I started, I wasn’t sure if anyone would be interested in what I had to share. Getting to 50,000 subscribers has been a slow (and sometimes messy) process—more about showing up consistently than achieving overnight success.\n\nMy biggest takeaway: Don’t wait for perfect videos. Make something useful, publish it, and improve as you go.\n\nThank you to everyone who’s been part of this. Whether you’ve watched a single video, left a comment, or shared the channel with a friend—I appreciate you. Excited to see what’s next for the channel.\n\nWhat’s a milestone you’re working toward right now?\n\nStep 7: Review for style, voice, flow\n- Matches Shaw’s voice (understated, factual, thankful, stepwise lesson)\n- No motivational language or rhetorical openers\n- Single em dash, used for voice/flow\n- White space for readability\n\nStep 8: Final Post Below",
