  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose and Audience\n- Purpose: Educational/self-reflection post, sharing lessons learned to help others avoid common mistakes and focus on what actually matters in AI projects.\n- Audience: Early career AI/ML professionals, students, and aspiring entrepreneurs (esp. those starting their journey in AI).\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n- Hook: 1–2 lines calling out \"here’s what I wish I knew starting in AI\" or hinting at lessons that save years.\n- Meat: Share the 5 principles with 1-2 sentence context per point — why it matters or how it changed Shaw’s approach.\n- CTA: Invite readers to share their own \"wish I'd known\" AI principles.\n\nStep 3: The Body\nAt 29, my approach to building with AI is radically different than when I started out. The lessons came from plenty of mistakes and hard-won experience. Here’s what I’d tell my younger self:\n\n- Don’t use AI just for the sake of it — Only use it when it actually solves a real problem.\n- Focus on problems, not tech — Start with a real-world pain point. The technology comes second.\n- Spend more time on data curation — Clean, structured, and representative data matters more than fancy models.\n- Data quality > data quantity — Ten great examples are far better than a thousand bad ones.\n- Run experiments — Progress in AI comes from running small, focused tests and iterating, not big bets.\n\nStep 4: The CTA\nWhat’s one AI lesson you wish you knew earlier in your career?\n\nStep 5: Brainstorming Hooks\nA. [User’s own phrasing] \"AI principles I know at 29, I wish I had known at 24.\"\nB. [Problem/solution] “Most people chase AI hype. Here’s what actually matters after five years in the field.”\nC. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “The biggest mistakes I made in my early AI career—all avoidable.”\nD. [Personal story] “At 24, I focused on the wrong things in AI. At 29, here’s what works.”\nE. [Number/list] “5 AI principles that would have saved me years of struggle.”\n\nNotes/angles:\n- A is direct and frames this as life/career advice (relatable)\n- D adds a personal touch\n- E calls out the specific value and the number of lessons\n\nStep 6: Choose the Best Hook\nBest fit: E (list format, direct value), slight adaptation of A for clarity and punch: “5 AI principles I wish I knew at 24 (now I’m 29).”\n\nStep 7: Full Draft, Voice and Style Review\n— Tone is direct, candid, educational; white space and concise points; no hype, no rhetorical openers; single em dash; checks all voice/style requirements.\n\nStep 8: Final Post\n",
  "final_post": "5 AI principles I wish I knew at 24 (now I’m 29)\n\nWhen I first started in AI, I focused on the shiny tools and fancy techniques. After a few years (and a lot of mistakes), here’s what I would tell my younger self:\n\n• Don’t use AI just for the sake of it — It should always be solving a real problem.\n• Focus on problems, not tech — Start with pain points, not algorithms.\n• Spend more time on data curation — Clean, representative data beats clever models every time.\n• Data quality > data quantity — Ten well-labeled examples are worth more than a thousand messy ones.\n• Run experiments — Make small, focused tests part of your regular process.\n\nWhat’s one lesson you wish you knew earlier in your AI journey?"
