  "input": "Share blog: fine-tuning FLUX.1 on my face!\n\nContext:\nAlthough large language models (LLMs) seem to get all the attention these days, image-generation models have been advancing just as rapidly. The current state-of-the-art is FLUX.1, an image model from Black Forest Labs (a faction from the Stable Diffusion team). In this article, I share the full process I used for fine-tuning this model to generate unlimited high-quality photos of myself.",
  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Educate and share content (Shaw’s new blog post) about fine-tuning FLUX.1 on his own face, highlighting advances in image-generation models and the hands-on process.\n- Audience: Fellow AI/ML enthusiasts, practitioners interested in image models, solopreneurs, and content creators exploring personalization with AI.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n[Hook about image-generation progress and hands-on personalization]\n[Short background on the model and why it’s interesting, then overview of the blog post: fine-tuned FLUX.1 to generate unlimited photos of Shaw, link to blog]\n[CTA: invite readers to read the blog, OR ask what model they’d fine-tune]\n\nStep 3: Body (meat)\n- LLMs are hyped, but image-generation models are rapidly advancing\n- FLUX.1 is state-of-the-art, from Black Forest Labs (Stable Diffusion connection)\n- Shaw fine-tuned the model on his own likeness\n- The blog post details the process: data gathering/prep, fine-tuning, sample outputs, tips\n- Anyone interested in personalized AI images might find it useful\n- Link to the blog\n\nStep 4: CTA or Question\nStrongest option: Which model would you fine-tune for your own use?\nAlternate: Have you tried image model fine-tuning?\nBut since the post is about the blog, and to drive engagement, I’ll end with: “Which model would you most want to personalize?”\n\nStep 5A: Hook Directions\n1. [Trend/urgency] “LLMs aren’t the only AI models making progress…image models are blowing up too”\n2. [Personal story] “Just fine-tuned FLUX.1 on my own face. Here’s how it went.”\n3. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “Most people focus on LLMs, but image models like FLUX.1 unlock a whole new world”\n4. [Results/outcome] “How I used FLUX.1 to generate unlimited photos of myself (with just a small dataset)”\n5. [User’s own phrasing] “Fine-tuning FLUX.1 on my face!”\n\nStep 5B: Notes\n1. LLM hype, but image models deserve attention, especially with personalization\n2. Personal project, approachable, transparency\n3. Highlight overlooked area, invite curiosity\n4. Emphasize capability and practicality\n5. Simple, straightforward teaser (per user)\n\nStep 5C: Choosing the strongest direction\nLet’s go with a hybrid of 1 and 2: call out the trend, but with a hands-on, personal twist. The audience is technical and curious about the practical process.\n\nFinal Hook:\n“LLMs get the headlines, but the real fun (and challenges) are happening with image-generation models.”\n\nStep 6: Full Draft\nLLMs get the headlines, but the real fun (and challenges) are happening with image-generation models.\n\nWhile large language models dominate most AI news, image models like FLUX.1 are making major leaps—and open up some amazing use cases. FLUX.1 is the latest from Black Forest Labs (part of the Stable Diffusion team), and its results are impressive.\n\nI recently fine-tuned FLUX.1 on my own face to generate unlimited high-quality photos—just for fun and experimentation.\n\nIn my latest blog, I break down the full process: data preparation, training, sample outputs, pitfalls, and tips for getting the best results. If you’re interested in personalized AI imagery, you might find it helpful.\n\nCheck it out here: [blog link]\n\nWhich model would you most want to personalize?\n\nStep 7: Review for Style, Voice, and Flow\n- Audit for tone: Approachable, hands-on, factual, not hypey\n- Scannability: Short paragraphs, white space\n- Only one em dash (justified), no repeated words in hook or first lines\n- Clear CTA at end\n- No assumed results or opinions beyond provided context\n- No rhetorical question opener\n\nStep 8: Final Post",
