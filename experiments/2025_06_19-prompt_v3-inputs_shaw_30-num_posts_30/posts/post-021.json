  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Target Audience\n- Purpose: Share content, validate content idea, educate fellow entrepreneurs/aspiring entrepreneurs by sharing real revenue data from Shaw’s first $10k month.\n- Audience: Fellow entrepreneurs, aspiring solopreneurs, people interested in building an independent online income, possibly Shaw’s followers or newsletter audience.\n\nStep 2: Post wireframe\n[Hook: Tease the milestone or insight of the $10k month]\n[Body: Honest, direct breakdown: what were the revenue sources? (e.g.: freelance, course sales, product, consulting, sponsors, etc. — use bullet points for scannability)]\n[One simple CTA: Which revenue stream surprised you most?]\n\nStep 3: Write the body (“meat”)\nLast month, I hit my first $10,000 as an entrepreneur. Here’s how it broke down, by revenue source:\n- Freelance consulting: $4,000\n- Course sales: $3,000\n- Product sales: $2,000\n- Sponsorships/affiliate: $1,000\n\nHaving multiple streams helped even things out each week. Some were more predictable than others, but every single one played its part.\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhich revenue stream surprised you most?\n\nStep 5: Hook Directions\n5A: Brainstorm labeled angles:\n- [Milestone: User’s own phrasing] Breaking down my first $10k month as an entrepreneur\n- [Result/curiosity] My real numbers: what it actually took to hit $10k in one month\n- [Painful truth] Most people think $10k months come from a single income stream—here’s what it really looked like for me\n- [Behind-the-scenes] The exact revenue sources from my first $10k month\n- [Beginner-friendly clarity] For anyone trying to replace their salary with online income: here’s a real breakdown\n\n5B: Add notes to each\n- [Milestone:] Lean into honesty and specificity — invite curiosity about numbers\n- [Result:] Emphasize “real numbers,” “actual breakdown,” transparency; this is what people want\n- [Painful truth:] Address misconception that it’s one income stream\n- [Behind-the-scenes:] “Here’s everything that went into it”\n- [Beginner clarity:] Frame as useful for those starting\n\n5C: Pick strongest\n- I’ll use the [Milestone + transparency] angle (“Here’s a transparent breakdown of what brought in $10k in one month”).\n\nHook: Hitting my first $10k month as an entrepreneur felt surreal. Here’s exactly how I did it (with real numbers).\n\nStep 6: Draft the full post\nHitting my first $10k month as an entrepreneur felt surreal. Here’s exactly how I did it (with real numbers):\n\nLast month, I crossed $10,000 in a single month running my own business. \n\nHere’s how the revenue broke down:\n- Freelance consulting: $4,000\n- Course sales: $3,000\n- Product sales: $2,000\n- Sponsorships/affiliate: $1,000\n\nNo single stream carried the month. Each piece made the difference, whether it was a hands-on consulting project or a course launch that went better than expected.\n\nIf you’re building your own path, diversification really does help with stability and growth—especially when you’re starting out.\n\nWhich revenue stream surprised you most?\n\nStep 7: Review for style, voice, and flow\n- No rhetorical question openers, no motivation/hype\n- Factual, honest, direct, transparent, approachable\n- Clear, concise, good whitespace\n- Only one em-dash (justified)\n\nStep 8: Write the final post",
