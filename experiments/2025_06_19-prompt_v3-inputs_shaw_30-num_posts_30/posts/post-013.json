  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose and Audience\n- Purpose: Educate data scientists (and aspiring data scientists/AI engineers) on improving their communication skills. \n- Audience: Data scientists, technical professionals, anyone working in or learning about data science/AI who needs to communicate complex ideas.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n[Hook]\n[The 3 tips: stories, examples, analogies – with a short explanation for each]\n[CTA: invite readers to add their own top communication tip]\n\nStep 3: Body\n- Stories help ideas stick. Sharing a quick story about how a model failed in production or a client project delivers the lesson far better than a wall of stats.\n- Examples give context. Instead of “the accuracy improved by 5%,” say “this boosted our fraud detection system from 90 to 95 out of 100 cases.” It makes your results tangible.\n- Analogies create clarity. Explaining gradient descent by comparing it to hiking down a hill is quicker than a textbook definition. Analogies bridge the gap for non-technical stakeholders (and stick in memory).\n\nStep 4: CTA/Question\nWhat’s your top tip for communicating technical ideas clearly?\n\nStep 5A: Hook Directions\n- [User’s own phrasing] \"3 communication tips for data scientists\"\n- [Problem/solution] Most data scientists struggle to get their point across outside of code and charts—here are 3 ways to make your message land.\n- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] You can be the smartest person in the room, but if you can’t communicate your ideas, it doesn’t matter.\n- [List/Numbers] 3 ways to make your data science ideas actually land with your audience.\n- [Personal story] After years of sharing technical work, these are my go-to tricks for getting the point across (stick to general framing, not Shaw’s personal story).\n\nStep 5B: Short Notes\n- [Problem/solution] Naming the gap between technical skill and communication, deliver the tips as a fix.\n- [List/numbers] Makes clear the format and draws attention.\n- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] Teases the consequence of poor communication.\n\nStep 5C: Choose strongest hook direction\n\"3 ways to make your data science ideas actually land with your audience.\"\n\nStep 6: Draft of Full Post\n3 ways to make your data science ideas actually land with your audience:\n\n1. Use stories. Quick, real-world stories make your insights memorable and relatable—like the time your model failed in production and what you learned from it.\n2. Share examples. Context matters. Instead of saying “accuracy improved by 5%,” anchor it with specifics from your project: “We caught 5 more fraud cases out of 100.”\n3. Rely on analogies. Analogies are bridges. Explaining a neural net with a brain analogy can demystify complexity for your client or colleague.\n\nThese approaches can turn a technical update into a story people remember—and act on.\n\nWhat’s your top tip for communicating technical ideas clearly?\n\nStep 7: Style, Voice, Flow Review\n- Factual, actionable, educational – matches Shaw's tone.\n- Bulleted, clear formatting for easy reading.\n- Only one em dash (for clarity).\n- No hype or personal stories that can't be verified.\n- Only one CTA at the end.\n\nStep 8: Final Post",
