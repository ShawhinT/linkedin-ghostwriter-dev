  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose and Audience\n- Purpose: Share and promote the blog post on multimodal embeddings.\n- Audience: AI practitioners, ML engineers, and anyone interested in cutting-edge AI techniques.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n- Hook: Observational or curiosity-driven opener about multimodal embeddings.\n- Meat: Brief summary of what multimodal embeddings are, why they matter, and what readers can learn from the blog post. Mention the link to the blog.\n- CTA: Ask what other resources or projects people have found useful for learning about multimodal embeddings.\n\nStep 3: Body\nMultimodal embeddings are a big leap for anyone building AI systems that understand both language and images, or other types of data at once. \n\nI've just published a new blog post breaking down what multimodal embeddings are, where they fit in the AI stack, and some practical examples you can try now. \n\nRead here: [blog link]\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhat’s your go-to resource or project for learning about multimodal embeddings?\n\nStep 5: Hook Brainstorm\n- [Problem/solution]: “Most embeddings cover just text or images—multimodal takes it further.”\n- [Trend/urgency]: “Multimodal embeddings are quickly becoming essential in AI pipelines.”\n- [Beginner-to-expert clarity]: “Confused by how models connect images and text? Multimodal embeddings are key.”\n- [User’s phrasing]: “Share blog: multimodal embeddings”\n\nStep 5A: Select strongest direction:\nTrend/urgency + beginner clarity: “Multimodal embeddings are quickly becoming essential in AI pipelines.”\n\nStep 6: Full Post Draft\nMultimodal embeddings are quickly becoming essential in modern AI pipelines.\n\nThey allow systems to connect information across text, images, and even audio—enabling powerful new applications that go beyond single-source models.\n\nI just published a blog post breaking down what multimodal embeddings are, how they work, and a few real-world examples you can use to get started.\n\nDive in here: [blog link]\n\nWhat’s your go-to resource or project for learning about multimodal embeddings?\n\nStep 7: Style, Voice, and Flow Review\n- Factual, direct, focused on practical insight and resources.\n- CTA asks for specific, technical recommendations.\n- No business clichés or motivational language.\n- Short, scannable, and matches Shaw’s approach.\n\nStep 8: Final Post",
