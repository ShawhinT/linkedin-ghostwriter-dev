  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose and Audience\n- Purpose: Share the free LLM course repo (educate + share resource), and lightly mention the upcoming AI Builders Cohort.\n- Target audience: Followers interested in learning about LLMs, potential students, self-learners, and technical builders, especially those eager to gain hands-on skills or join a cohort.\n\nStep 2: Post Wireframe\n- Hook: Frame around quality and accessibility of free LLM resources + personal motivation for sharing.\n- Meat: Introduce the free LLM course GitHub repo, briefly describe what it covers, how it can help, and why it's worth checking out. Practical details for self-learners.\n- CTA: Ask for favorite LLM learning resources to expand the list or what people want covered next.\n- P.S.: Mention the AI Builders Cohort is coming soon for those who want hands-on support/community.\n\nStep 3: Body\nI’m seeing a lot of confusion about where to actually learn LLM development from the ground up, for free. So I curated and contributed to a community-driven GitHub repo that covers:\n- LLM basics (architecture, tokenization, etc.)\n- Prompting and prompt engineering\n- How to use open-source LLMs\n- Fine-tuning and evaluation\n- Real project walkthroughs (with code)\n\nIt’s meant for self-paced learning. No paywall, no hidden upsells.\n\nHere’s the repo: [insert GitHub link]\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhat would you add to this repo—or what LLM topics are you most curious to learn next?\n\nStep 5: Hooks (Brainstormed Directions)\nA. [User’s intention] \"Free LLM course — GitHub repo now live\"\nB. [Problem/solution] \"Most free AI courses skip the hands-on part. This repo doesn’t.\"\nC. [Results/outcome] “Learn LLMs by building real projects (for free)”\nD. [Trend/urgency] “The best free LLM resource I’ve seen for 2024—just open sourced”\nE. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “Confused on where to start with LLMs? Here’s a stepwise path”\n\nStep 5B: Notes & Expansion\nA. User’s intention: Factual, straightforward, but may not compel a click\nB. Problem/solution: Speaks to frustration with passive/fake-free courses, sets up value prop of repo\nC. Results/outcome: Focuses on active learning by doing\nD. Trend/urgency: Invites people to check out something new and timely\nE. Beginner-to-expert clarity: Solves for “where do I begin?”\n\nStep 5C: Select Strongest Direction\nB. The “most free courses skip the hands-on” angle is likely to connect with technical, practical audience and aligns with Shaw’s voice. Will use B with literal, direct phrasing.\n\nStep 6: Draft Post\nMost free AI courses skip the hands-on part. This repo doesn’t.\n\nI helped curate a community-driven GitHub repo for learning LLMs—focused on actually building, not just theory:\n\n- LLM basics and architecture\n- Prompt engineering (with examples)\n- Using open-source LLMs\n- Fine-tuning and evals\n- Real projects (with code walkthroughs)\n\nThe goal: give you a step-by-step path from zero to building your own LLM-powered apps. All free, open, and self-paced.\n\nRepo: [insert GitHub link]\n\nWhat would you add to the repo—or what LLM topics do you want broken down next?\n\nP.S. Speaking of hands-on learning: If you want structured, project-based support, the next AI Builders Cohort is launching soon.\n\nStep 7: Review For Style/Voice/Flow\n- Factual and practical intro, no hype, no rhetorical questions.\n- Bullet points for scannability.\n- Literal CTA focused on actionable additions or requests from readers.\n- Brief, optional, but clear P.S. mentioning the cohort without being pushy.\n- No business clichés, idioms, or motivational tropes.\n- Tone is expert/mentor/peer.\n- Cross-checked tone and structure with example posts 1 & 4 (aligned).\n\nStep 8: Final Post\n",
