  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Target Audience\n- Purpose: Educate data scientists on practical communication techniques they can use in their work.\n- Audience: Data scientists (and perhaps technical professionals) looking to communicate complex topics more clearly to different audiences.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n[Hook]\n[3 concrete tips, each briefly explained]\n[CTA: ask for other practical techniques]\n\nStep 3: Body (Meat)\n\nHere are three techniques I've seen help technical folks connect fast:\n\n1) Use stories—Putting a concept into a real-world story helps people remember it and gives context for why it matters.\n2) Use examples—Start with an actual dataset, model, or scenario. This keeps things concrete (instead of abstract) and shows the impact in action.\n3) Use analogies—If you can relate a technical point to something everyday (\"logistic regression is like sorting apples into two bins\"), you help non-technical colleagues connect the dots.\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhat other communication tricks have you found useful as a data scientist?\n\nStep 5: Brainstorm Hook Directions\n- [Problem/solution] “Why do so many data scientists lose their audience? Three techniques to help you connect.”\n- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “How to make technical concepts stick—even for non-technical teams.”\n- [List/number] “3 ways technical experts can make their ideas clearer.”\n- [Direct/curiosity] “Most data scientists can build a model—but can you explain your results?”\n- [User’s own phrasing] “3 communication tips for data scientists.”\n\nStep 6: Choose Hook Direction and Write Final Hook\nI’ll pick the “Most data scientists can build a model—but can you explain your results?”\n\nStep 7: Draft of the Full Post\nMost data scientists can build a model—but can you explain your results?\n\nHere are three communication techniques I see make a real difference:\n\n1) Use stories—Frame your method with a real-world scenario to give it meaning.\n2) Use examples—Show what you mean using a real dataset or application.\n3) Use analogies—Relate technical ideas to everyday situations to help non-technical teammates follow along.\n\nWhat other communication techniques have helped you as a data scientist?\n\nStep 8: Review for style, voice, and flow\n- Scannable, practical, friendly peer-to-peer tone\n- No motivational language, only practical advice\n- CTA focuses on factual/procedural communication tricks\n- Literal and direct language (no business clichés)\n- No more than one em dash\n- Voice and structure match examples 1, 5\n\nStep 9: Write the final post",
  "final_post": "Most data scientists can build a model—but can you explain your results?\n\nHere are three techniques I see help technical folks communicate clearly:\n\n1) Use stories—Share a real scenario to give context and make the problem feel relevant.\n2) Use examples—Start with actual data or a concrete case to show what you mean.\n3) Use analogies—Connect technical concepts to everyday ideas so non-technical teammates can follow along.\n\nWhat other communication techniques have helped you as a data scientist?"
