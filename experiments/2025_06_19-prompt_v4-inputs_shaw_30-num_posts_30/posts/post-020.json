  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose and Audience\n- Purpose: Share practical, technical takeaways from a paid mentorship session with an entrepreneur earning $100k/month, to educate fellow entrepreneurs and freelancers on actionable strategies that drive significant business growth.\n- Target Audience: Fellow solopreneurs, technical freelancers, and early-stage founders who want to move from $5k–$10k months to greater scale, and who may over-focus on tech or skill-building over business fundamentals.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n[Engaging 1-2 line hook]\n[Body: Key practical insights from the session, each as a clear point with practical context]\n[CTA: Invite the audience to add their own hard-learned business shifts/practices]\n\nStep 3: Body\nAfter paying a $100k/month entrepreneur for a direct consult, I realized how different their approach is from what most technical founders (myself included) focus on. Here are my biggest takeaways:\n\n- Customer pain beats credentials: Your customer cares about their pain points being solved—not your tech stack or CV.\n- Value-based pricing: The top earners price for the client’s perceived value, not hours or scope. Time is almost irrelevant in their proposals.\n- Higher price tag = longer pitch: The more you charge, the more explanation and detailed proof you need. High-ticket sales take patience and trust-building.\n- Specificity attracts: The most effective entrepreneurs define their target customer (avatar) to a crazy level of detail, then attract them with valuable free content.\n- Strategy scales, not skills: The leap from $10k/month to $100k/month is usually a business model or strategy shift, not the result of working harder or learning a new framework.\n\nStep 4: CTA/Question\nWhat’s the most practical business shift you’ve made that helped you grow your income?\n\nStep 5: Brainstorm Hooks\nA) [User’s phrasing] “I paid a $100k/mo entrepreneur to talk to me… here’s what I learned.”\nB) [Problem/solution] “Technical skills aren’t what separates $10k/mo and $100k/mo businesses. Here are the real levers that matter. ”\nC) [Numbers/results] “The gap between $10k and $100k months isn’t just about code—these 5 business strategies make the difference.”\nD) [Clarity/counterintuitive] “Most freelancers over-focus on skills. The best I know focus on these 5 things instead.”\nE) [Personal learning] “After a $100k/month entrepreneur reviewed my business, these shifts changed how I operate.”\n\nShort notes for the directions:\nA) User’s own opens with curiosity and credibility.\nB) Problem/solution leans into the reader’s likely frustration.\nC) Numbers drive intrigue and signal specific actionable takeaways.\nD) Counterintuitive angle exposes a common error.\nE) Personal learning brings humility and relatability.\n\nStep 6: Choose strongest hook\nA) User’s own phrasing is strong, direct, and signals insight. Will use as is.\n\nStep 7: Compose draft of full post:\n---\nI paid a $100k/month entrepreneur to talk to me… here’s what I learned.\n\nMost engineers think better skills or more hours are the answer.\nBut here’s what the top earners do differently:\n\n- Focus on real customer pain, not experience or tech stack.\n- Price based on value delivered, not time spent.\n- Bigger price tags require more explanation, longer copy, and more patience pre-sale.\n- Get ultra-specific on your target customer—then bring them in with valuable free content.\n- The difference between $10k and $100k/month is usually a business or strategy pivot, not an upgrade in technical ability.\n\nWhat’s the most practical business shift you’ve made that helped you grow your income?\n\nStep 8: Flow/Style Review and Final Post Checklist\n- Em dash audit: There’s one, but easily removed for direct flow.\n- No business clichés, no motivational language, just stepwise, literal points.\n- Matches voice and structure from example posts (e.g., Example 1 and Example 2).\n\nFinal tweaks: Remove “Most engineers think…” and open more directly after the hook to stay within Shaw’s voice.\n\nFinal version below.",
  "final_post": "I paid a $100k/month entrepreneur to talk to me… here’s what I learned.\n\nHere are the shifts that stood out:\n\n- Customer pain points matter more than your skills or portfolio.\n- Price your offer for the value it delivers—not the time you spend.\n- The bigger the price tag, the longer (and more thorough) the pitch. Build trust before asking for the sale.\n- Get extremely clear on who you serve, then attract that exact audience with helpful free content.\n- The difference between $10k and $100k/month is usually in strategy—what you offer, who you sell to, and how you position it—not your technical stack.\n\nWhat’s the most practical business shift you’ve made that helped you grow your income?"
