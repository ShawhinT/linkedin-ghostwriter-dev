  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Educate; provide a step-by-step actionable plan for beginners who want to break into AI in 2025. \n- Target audience: Absolute beginners interested in learning AI, but also relevant to people looking to guide others into AI or update their learning path.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n[Hook: Clear, curiosity-driven focus on \"How I'd learn AI from scratch in 2025\"]\n[Body: Simple, actionable step-by-step plan with brief explanations for each stage]\n[CTA: Ask for additional steps or resources others would add to this plan]\n\nStep 3: Body (“Meat”)\nHere’s a stepwise plan for someone starting from zero:\n\n1) Use ChatGPT (or a similar AI) — Start by getting comfortable with modern AI tools. Experiment, ask questions, and treat it as your learning assistant.\n2) Install Python — All practical AI development starts here. Getting set up on your machine opens the door to every hands-on project.\n3) Build a simple automation — As a beginner, pick something useful: automate a report, scrape text, batch-rename files. This cements the basics (inputs, outputs, and scripting).\n4) Build a beginner ML project — Use open datasets (like Titanic, MNIST). Try training a basic model and see how different parameters affect results.\n5) Build a real-world project — Take what you’ve learned and apply it to something that matters to you: maybe a chatbot, a personal dashboard, or a custom analysis.\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhat would you add to this beginner-to-pro AI roadmap?\n\nStep 5: HOOK DIRECTIONS\nA. [Literal framing] How I’d start learning AI in 2025 if I was a complete beginner\nB. [Problem/solution] Most “AI learning roadmaps” are too complex—here’s a simple 5-step path\nto get started.\nC. [Trend angle] AI has changed a lot. Here’s how I’d break in now (if I were starting over).\nD. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] You don’t need a PhD:\nHere’s my 5-step plan for learning AI from scratch in 2025.\nE. [User’s own phrasing] How I’d learn AI in 2025 (if I knew nothing)\n\nStep 5A/B brainstorm notes:\n- A literal, direct hook works with this content.\n- Problem/solution is tempting (“most roadmaps are messy”), but might add friction.\n- Trend angle would work if user hints at AI shifts; not in their current notes.\n- Clarity: “You don’t need a PhD”—could be interpreted as anti-hype, but we don’t want to be motivational.\n\nStep 5C: Final hook: \"How I’d start learning AI in 2025 (if I knew nothing)\"\n\nStep 6: Draft of Full Post\n\nHow I’d start learning AI in 2025 (if I knew nothing)\n\nHere’s the step-by-step plan I’d follow:\n\n1) Use ChatGPT (or a similar tool as your learning assistant)\n2) Install Python (it’s the foundation for all practical AI work)\n3) Build a simple automation (start small—automate a report or scrape web data)\n4) Create a beginner ML project (work with a classic dataset and train a basic model)\n5) Build a real-world project (apply what you’ve learned to something that solves a real problem for you)\n\nEvery step gives you tangible experience and a foundation for the next one.\n\nWhat would you add to this roadmap?\n\nStep 7: Review for style, voice, and flow\n- Open is factual, curiosity-driven, uses “How I’d start...”\n- Simple, literal, with actionable steps\n- White space and bullets for readability\n- One focused CTA\n- No business clichés or motivational language\n- Voice matches example posts (e.g., Example 5, Example 3)\n- No em dashes\n- Factual, clear, and approachable\n\nStep 8: Final Post\n\n",
