  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose and Audience\n- Purpose: Share a useful technical resource/book (Super Study Guide: Transformers & Large Language Models) with the LinkedIn audience. The purpose is to educate readers and surface a resource specifically for LLM practitioners—possibly validate interest in this kind of reference or gather other recommendations.\n- Audience: AI engineers, data scientists, and practitioners who are interested in building and deploying LLMs, as well as those looking to deepen their expertise around Transformers and productionizing LLMs.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n- Hook: Short intro that surfaces the utility and niche of the guidebook for LLM engineers (possibly referencing the need for practical, production-focused resources).\n- Body: Brief personal context, description of what the book is and who it’s for, and why it might be helpful.\n- CTA: Ask readers to share their go-to resource for LLMs or to add to the list of high-quality technical books for LLM engineering.\n\nStep 3: Body\nMost LLM content online is either too high-level or too academic for building real-world applications. Super Study Guide: Transformers & Large Language Models (\"Building LLMs for Production\") fills the gap—it's a hands-on, technical resource written for those shipping LLM-powered products and features.\n\nStep 4: CTA or Question\nWhat’s your favorite guide or textbook for working with LLMs?\n\nStep 5: Hook (Brainstorm Directions)\n5A - Label and short notes:\n- [User’s own phrasing]: \"Book share. Super Study Guide: Transformers & Large Language Models.\"\n- [Trend/urgency]: \"LLMs are everywhere, but most guides are not written for real-world production.\"\n- [Problem/solution]: \"Tired of theory? Here’s a practical guide for building with LLMs.\"\n- [Beginner-to-expert clarity]: \"If you want to engineer LLMs (not just prompt), here’s a reference you might want.\"\n- [Results/outcomes]: \"The best hands-on LLM resource I’ve found for builders.\"\n\n5B - Notes:\n- [User’s phrasing]: Direct, but doesn’t grab attention; might work if paired with context.\n- [Trend]: Play up the gap—plenty of LLM content, little that's practical.\n- [Problem/solution]: Engineers need actionable, technical resources—not theory.\n- [Clarity]: Book advances practitioners from basic prompts to productionizing.\n- [Results]: Claims about being the \"best\" may be risky without direct experience, better to stay observational.\n\n5C - Chosen Hook: “Most LLM resources don’t cover production. Here’s one designed for practitioners.”\n\nStep 6: Draft of Full Post\nMost LLM resources don’t cover production. Here’s one designed for practitioners.\n\nIf you’re building LLM-powered products, most guides are either too high-level or focused on research.\n\nSuper Study Guide: Transformers & Large Language Models (subtitled “Building LLMs for Production”) fills that gap. It’s written as a practical handbook for shipping real-world AI features, not just running demos.\n\nIf you’re looking for: \n- A technical intro to Transformers\n- Practical recipes for deploying LLMs\n- Reference material for engineering teams\n\n…it’s worth a look.\n\nWhat’s your go-to reference for building with LLMs?\n\nStep 7: Review for style, voice, and flow\n- Tone is factual, clear, and peer-to-peer. Direct, practical, no hype or business clichés.\n- CTA gives a factual, technical engagement prompt.\n- Formatting is clean and scannable.\n- No motivational or reflection language.\n- One em dash, used for clarity; justified.\n- Cross-checked with examples: Style and voice align well.\n\nStep 8: Final Post\n",
