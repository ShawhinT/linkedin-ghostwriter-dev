  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Share Shaw's journey from 0 to $70k, emphasizing practical, educational lessons learned that can help fellow entrepreneurs or AI freelancers.\n- Audience: Early-stage entrepreneurs, AI freelancers, solopreneurs, and those interested in practical milestones and lessons.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n[Hook teasing transparent numbers or lessons]\n\n[Quick background: Starting point, brief context, and then actionable lessons learned]\n\n[Clear, practical CTA prompting readers to share their own best practical lesson or tactic for growing income]\n\nStep 3: Body (Meat)\n- Briefly mention starting with zero as a solopreneur/freelancer\n- Specific, numbered lessons that contributed practically to going from 0 to $70k (e.g. focusing on finding one paid client first, charging for value not time, building in public, prioritizing repeat business, etc.)\n- Close noting $70k is not the finish line, but a milestone that surfaced valuable lessons\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhat’s the most practical thing you’ve done to grow your income as a freelancer or founder?\n\nStep 5: Hook Directions\n5A: Brainstorm Hook Directions\n- [User’s own phrasing] My Journey from 0 to 70k (key lessons)\n- [Transparency/numbers] \"How I went from $0 to $70k as a solo entrepreneur—here’s what actually worked.\"\n- [Problem/solution] \"Most freelancers get stuck earning < $10k/year. Here’s how I broke out of that trap.\"\n- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] \"The advice that finally moved me from zero to steady income as a creator.\"\n- [Common misconception] \"More work doesn’t mean more money in freelancing—here’s what matters instead.\"\n5B: Add short notes to each direction\n- [Transparency/numbers] Communicates real data, attracts entrepreneurs/freelancers hungry for practical steps\n- [Problem/solution] Focuses on being stuck at low income, provides clear steps\n- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] Aha moments that drive trajectory change\n- [Common misconception] Calls out popular—but ineffective—approaches\n5C: Choose the strongest direction: Transparency/numbers—this matches Shaw’s style in other milestone posts, e.g. “first $10k month,” and supports the literal, actionable tone.\n\nStep 6: Draft Full Post\nHow I went from $0 to $70k as a solo entrepreneur—here’s what actually worked.\n\nWhen I started, I had zero clients, no audience, and no playbook. $70k later, here are my most practical lessons:\n\n1) Find one paying client. Don’t get distracted by fancy websites or marketing funnels. Focus your effort on getting the first real user who will pay for your work. Everything else comes later.\n\n2) Charge for value—not hours. My income accelerated when I switched from hourly rates to pricing based on client outcomes. This not only raised my effective rate, but also helped me attract more serious clients.\n\n3) Build in public. Sharing what I was learning and building (even as a beginner) created serendipity. People reached out with opportunities I never would have found otherwise.\n\n4) Prioritize repeat business. Long-term client relationships are less stressful and more profitable than constantly chasing new projects. Focus on delivering real value so clients want to stay.\n\n$70k is just a milestone, not a finish line—but these shifts made the biggest difference for me.\n\nWhat’s the most practical thing you’ve done to grow your income as a freelancer or founder?\n\nStep 7: Review\n- Tone is literal, friendly, factual, and numbers-driven—like example-2 and example-3.\n- Hook is transparent and curiosity-driven, with a literal number.\n- Each lesson is practical and actionable, with zero motivational or figurative summarizing language.\n- CTA is singular, actionable, and in Shaw’s voice\n- Em dash appears only once (as in “$70k is just a milestone, not a finish line”) and is justified for flow.\n- There are no business clichés, tricolons with negation, or figurative/motivational lines.\n\nStep 8: Write the final post.",
