  "writing_steps": "Step 1: \n- Purpose: Share useful educational content about fine-tuning LLMs using MLX (likely a technical tutorial or resource). Validate interest and drive discussion around technical processes/tools.\n- Target audience: Technical audience—AI engineers, ML practitioners, and those exploring fine-tuning LLMs on Apple Silicon or interested in the MLX library.\n\nStep 2 (Post Wireframe):\n[Hook teasing practical/technical insight into fine-tuning LLMs with MLX]\n[One paragraph explaining what’s in the video and why it matters]\n[Link to video]\n[Specific, technical CTA or question: invite people to share their experience, tips, or questions about using MLX or fine-tuning LLMs]\n\nStep 3 (The Meat):\nIf you’re interested in fine-tuning large language models directly on Apple Silicon, MLX is now one of the most accessible libraries. I just published a video walkthrough that covers:\n- Setting up your Mac for MLX\n- Running a basic fine-tune (with code!)\n- Key differences vs. PyTorch and Hugging Face workflows\nThis is especially useful if you’re looking to save on cloud compute costs or want to iterate quickly on local hardware.\n\nStep 4 (CTA):\nWhat have your experiences been fine-tuning LLMs on local hardware (or with MLX)?\n\nStep 5 (Hooks — brainstorm directions):\n1. [Problem/solution] “Cloud GPU prices too high? You can fine-tune LLMs on your Mac, no cluster needed.”\n2. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “Most tutorials skip over local fine-tuning. Here’s how to do it with MLX.”\n3. [Trend/urgency] “More LLM devs are looking for alternatives to cloud-based training. MLX just made it a lot easier.”\n4. [Personal process] “I just recorded a step-by-step walkthrough for LLM fine-tuning with MLX on Mac.”\n5. [User’s phrasing] “Fine-tuning LLMs with MLX.”\n\nNotes for each:\n- 1: Addresses the pain of cloud compute cost, appeals to DIY/independent devs\n- 2: Focuses on an underserved area (most focus on giants like Hugging Face)\n- 3: Ties to trend, might spark higher urgency\n- 4: Puts focus on author’s process, but must stay literal\n- 5: Too generic unless made more concrete\n\nPick strongest: #1 — clear pain point and practical solution. Mix with #2’s emphasis on technical clarity.\n\nStep 6 (Draft of Full Post):\nCloud GPU prices adding up? There’s now an easier way to fine-tune LLMs—directly on your Mac.\n\nI just published a video walking through the step-by-step process of using MLX for local LLM fine-tuning. In the video, you’ll learn how to:\n- Set up Mac for MLX (on Apple Silicon)\n- Run a full fine-tuning job (with code you can copy)\n- Compare MLX’s workflow to PyTorch and Hugging Face\n\nIf you’ve been curious about training LLMs without cloud infrastructure, this may save you time and money.\n\nWatch the full video here: [LINK]\n\nWhat’s your experience fine-tuning LLMs on local hardware (or with MLX)?\n\nStep 7 (Style Review):\n- Hook is clear, practical, no rhetorical question\n- No personal results, only facts about the video and process\n- Technical details, literal language\n- Scannable formatting\n- Voice: approachable, factual, technical\n- CTA: single actionable question, no reflection or motivation\n- Checked for clichés, idioms—none present\n\nStep 8 (Final Post):",
