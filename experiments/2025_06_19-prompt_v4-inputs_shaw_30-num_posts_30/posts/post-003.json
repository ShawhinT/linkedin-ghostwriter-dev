  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Validate a content idea and educate readers about the value of taking action (building) over overthinking or assuming others have more innate talent. The aim is practical/educational with a hint of encouragement to lower perceived barriers.\n- Audience: Aspiring AI engineers/technologists, new developers, or anyone feeling intimidated by top performers in AI. Fellow entrepreneurs and learners.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n[Hook: Address the myth that top AI engineers are somehow inherently smarter; tease the key differentiator.]\n[Body: Explain that most top AI engineers simply out-build others. Break down what 'building' looks like versus passive learning or self-doubt. Suggest realistic next steps or habits for the reader.]\n[CTA: Ask for a practical tip or action readers have taken to move from learning to building.]\n\nStep 3: Body\nThe AI space can feel intimidating—especially when it seems like top engineers are on another level. \n\nBut from what I’ve seen, their biggest edge isn’t raw intelligence. It’s the willingness to build, test, and ship real projects.\n\nIt looks like:\n- Starting small (even with messy, unfinished projects)\n- Focusing on usable prototypes instead of endless research\n- Treating every build as a learning opportunity\n\nHere’s something actionable: stop worrying if your project is “good enough.” Publish a basic demo, share your code, or automate a personal workflow. You’ll learn far more from one finished project than ten tutorials.\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhat’s the last small project you built to apply a new skill?\n\nStep 5A: Hook Directions\n1. [User’s own phrasing] “Most top AI engineers aren’t more intelligent than you. They just do this one thing more… BUILD”\n2. [Problem/solution] “Intimidated by AI? The real difference isn’t intelligence—it’s what you do with your time.”\n3. [Common misconception] “Why you don’t need to be a genius to stand out in AI (but you do need to build).”\n4. [Personal challenge] “I used to think I needed to be ‘smarter’ to break into AI…”\n\nStep 5B: Hook Brainstorm Notes\n1. [User’s own phrasing] Emphasize building as the key differentiator; direct and punchy, matches the user’s tone. \n2. [Problem/solution] Reframe the intimidation, offer building as solution.\n3. [Common misconception] Clarify that practical effort beats theory.\n4. [Personal challenge] Could try reframing as a broader lesson, but no personal anecdote provided.\n\nStep 5C: Pick strongest: User’s phrasing is clear, direct, and fits the advice style. Clean up flow for even greater clarity.\n\nStep 6: Draft of Full Post\nMost top AI engineers aren’t more intelligent than you.\n\nThey just do one thing more: they build.\n\nIn my experience, the gap comes down to action—not raw brainpower. \n\nMost experts ship messy prototypes, test half-formed ideas, and treat every project (even the simple ones) as a chance to learn something new. They aren’t afraid to publish unfinished work or try an experiment just for the sake of building.\n\nWorrying if your project is “good enough” holds you back. One finished demo teaches you more than ten hours of reading or tutorials.\n\nWhat’s the last small project you built to apply a new skill?\n\nStep 7: Style & Voice Review\n- Hook is direct, factual, and clear.\n- Body uses stepwise insight and literal language; educational tone.\n- CTA is practical/factual, not motivational or reflective.\n- No cliché, business idiom, or motivational platitudes.\n- Voice matches Shaw: approachable, honest, technical, humble. Cross-referenced with Example 1 and Example 2.\n\nStep 8: Final Post",
  "final_post": "Most top AI engineers aren’t more intelligent than you.\n\nThey just build more.\n\nThe real difference isn’t raw intelligence—it’s putting ideas into practice.\n\nTop engineers:\n- Start with small, messy prototypes\n- Ship projects before they’re perfect\n- See every experiment as a learning opportunity\n\nIf you want to close the gap, focus on action—not just theory. One finished demo teaches you more than ten hours of tutorials.\n\nWhat’s the last small project you built to apply a new skill?"
