  "input": "Share blog: compressing LLMs.\n\nSnippet: While the immense scale of LLMs is responsible for their impressive performance across a wide range of use cases, this presents challenges in their application to real-world problems. In this article, I discuss how we can overcome these challenges by compressing LLMs. I start with a high-level overview of key concepts and then walk through a concrete example with Python code.",
  "writing_steps": "Step 1: \n- Purpose: Share and drive traffic to the blog post about compressing LLMs, while giving a technical preview and piquing interest.\n- Target audience: AI engineers, developers, and practitioners interested in deploying LLMs or improving their efficiency.\n\nStep 2: \nWireframe:\n[Hook]\n[Why LLM compression matters]\n[Preview of what the blog covers]\n[Link]\n[CTA]\n\nStep 3: \nBody:\nLarge language models are powerful, but their scale creates real obstacles for many practical deployments. Model size impacts everything from latency to hardware costs.\n\nThe blog shares:\n- An overview of the main concepts in LLM compression\n- A concrete example with Python code so you can see the process step by step\n\nStep 4: \nCTA: What tools or techniques have you used for compressing models in production?\n\nStep 5: \nBrainstorming hook directions:\n1. [Challenge/solution] \"LLMs are huge—but that doesn’t mean you can’t use them in production.\"\n2. [Technical angle] \"Deploying LLMs isn’t just about performance on benchmarks—it’s about making them fit into real products.\"\n3. [Snippet as hook] \"While the immense scale of LLMs is responsible for their impressive performance, this presents challenges in real applications.\"\n4. [Practical value] \"You can cut model size without losing the performance you care about.\"\n5. [Trend/urgency] \"LLM compression is quickly becoming a must-know for AI practitioners.\"\n\nBest direction: #1 is strongest—direct, factual, and sets up the problem and solution directly.\n\nHook: LLMs are huge—but that doesn’t mean you can’t use them in production.\n\nStep 6: \nFull draft:\nLLMs are huge—but that doesn’t mean you can’t use them in production.\n\nThe scale is impressive—and a real bottleneck for many deployments. Size affects everything from latency to hardware costs.\n\nIn my new blog, I break down:\n- The core concepts of compressing LLMs (high-level overview)\n- A hands-on example with Python code so you can follow the process\n\nCheck it out here: [BLOG LINK]\n\nWhat tools or techniques have you used for compressing models in production?\n\nStep 7:\n- Voice is factual, direct, and technical.\n- Hook is plain and curiosity-driven.\n- Body previews exactly what’s inside.\n- CTA is technical and specific.\n- No motivational language or figurative/cliché.\n- Only one em dash.\n\nStep 8: \nFinal post follows below.",
