  "input": "Share blog: fine-tuning FLUX.1 on my face!\n\nContext:\nAlthough large language models (LLMs) seem to get all the attention these days, image-generation models have been advancing just as rapidly. The current state-of-the-art is FLUX.1, an image model from Black Forest Labs (a faction from the Stable Diffusion team). In this article, I share the full process I used for fine-tuning this model to generate unlimited high-quality photos of myself.",
  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Share a new blog post on fine-tuning the FLUX.1 image-generation model for personalized photo generation. Educate on process and drive traffic to the blog.\n- Audience: Tech-savvy AI practitioners, developers, ML enthusiasts interested in image-generation models, and Shaw’s audience following LLMs but curious about recent advances in diffusion/image generation.\n\nStep 2: Post Wireframe\n- Hook: Contrast LLM hype with exciting progress in image models; highlight FLUX.1 and personalization angle\n- Meat: Brief on FLUX.1’s origins/state-of-the-art position, summary of fine-tuning and what’s covered in the blog (full process, personalized image generation), why this is notable/relevant\n- Link: Blog post\n- CTA: Ask readers if they’ve experimented with personalization in image models\n\nStep 3: Body (“Meat”)\n- LLMs get most of the attention, but models like FLUX.1 are making major leaps.\n- FLUX.1: Developed by Black Forest Labs, from part of the original Stable Diffusion team\n- I wanted to see how far we’ve come with personalized image generation—so I documented the full process of fine-tuning FLUX.1 on my own face\n- The result: unlimited, high-quality photos of myself generated by the model\n- In my new blog post: detailed walkthrough, dataset prep, model config, training workflow, sample results, practical tips\n- Blog link\n\nStep 4: CTA\n- Have you tried personalized training with image generation models yet?\n\nStep 5A: Hook Direction Brainstorm\n1. [Trend/Contrast] “LLMs get all the attention, but image-generation tech is evolving fast too.”\n2. [Results/Tease] “I fine-tuned FLUX.1 to generate unlimited photos of myself—here’s how.”\n3. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “Most miss how powerful image models have become. Here’s my step-by-step process with FLUX.1.”\n4. [Problem/solution] “Getting a model to generate quality images of yourself is easier than you think—with FLUX.1 and a bit of fine-tuning.”\n5. [User’s own phrasing] “Fine-tuning FLUX.1 on my face.”\n\nStep 5B: Direction Notes\n1. [Trend/Contrast] Image models advancing under the radar. Set context, then lead to personal project.\n2. [Results/Tease] Immediate curiosity—why would you want unlimited photos? Tease the result as proof.\n3. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] Appeal to those not following image models—offer a concrete path into them.\n4. [Problem/solution] Addresses technical pain point directly, offers solution with FLUX.1.\n5. [User’s phrasing] Unique hook, but benefits from clarity/context for broadest appeal.\n\nStep 5C: Hook Selection & Final Hook\n- Strongest: [Trend/Contrast] “LLMs get all the hype, but image-generation models are catching up fast.”\n\nStep 6: Full Draft\nLLMs get all the hype, but image-generation models are catching up fast.\n\nThe latest: FLUX.1, the new diffusion model from Black Forest Labs (by some of the team behind Stable Diffusion).\n\nTo test just how powerful these models have become, I fine-tuned FLUX.1 on my own face—generating unlimited high-quality photos of myself with just a handful of images.\n\nIn my new blog post, I break down the entire process:\n- Dataset prep\n- Model configuration\n- Training workflow\n- Practical tips\n- Example results\n\nRead the full step-by-step guide here:\n[Blog link]\n\nHave you tried personalized training with image models yet?\n\nStep 7: Review for Style, Voice, and Flow\n- Tone is factual, approachable, lightly technical, and practical.\n- CTA is single, literal, focused.\n- White space and bullets aid readability.\n- No business clichés or idioms.\n- Follows the “educational, practical, and technical” guideline. References concrete steps and process.\n\nStep 8: Final Post",
