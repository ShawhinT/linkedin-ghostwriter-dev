  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose and Target Audience\n- Purpose: Educate and promote a free guide; share practical project ideas across the AI spectrum (Software 1.0 to 3.0).\n- Target Audience: Aspiring AI engineers, technical creators, and anyone interested in hands-on AI projects (beginners to advanced).\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n[Hook: Calls out the scope/utility of building 30 AI projects in 1 weekend, emphasizes breadth—from classic to cutting-edge, and teases a free guide.]\n[Meat: Short intro explaining the three \"layers\" (Software 1.0, 2.0, 3.0), then quick list/summary of project types included for each. Emphasize practicality—no fluff.]\n[Link to free guide.]\n[CTA: Ask for project ideas readers would add to the list.]\n\nStep 3: Meat\n- There are three major “layers” for AI builders today:\n  • Software 1.0: Data analysis, cleaning, pipelines—use code to prepare and process info\n  • Software 2.0: Build actual ML and predictive systems (think classic models and neural nets)\n  • Software 3.0: The new frontier—build LLM-powered tools, automate with agents, do RAG, tune models yourself\n- The free guide has 30 hands-on project ideas, from scraping and visualizing real-world data, to training simple classifiers, to prototyping RAG chatbots and automations with OpenAI or open-source models.\n- Every project is scoped for a weekend (or less) and has practical learning value. \n\nStep 4: CTA\n👉 What’s one AI project idea you’d add?\n\nStep 5: Hooks (brainstormed directions)\nA. [User’s own phrasing] \"30 AI Projects You Can Build This Weekend (Free Guide)\"\nB. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “Most lists focus on one kind of project. Here’s 30 from analysis to fine-tuning.”\nC. [Problem/solution] “Confused by which AI projects to build? I organized 30 you can actually finish—and learn from.”\nD. [Results] “You can build a real AI portfolio in a month—here’s 30 weekend-sized projects to pick from.”\nE. [Trend/urgency] “GenAI is just a part of modern AI building—don’t skip the fundamentals. Here’s projects from 1.0 through 3.0.”\n\nStep 5B: Notes on directions\nA. User phrasing is clear, direct, and covers volume\nB. Position as full-spectrum; good for leveling-up.\nC. Solution/problem—good for explaining pain point\nD. Portfolio approach is aspirational, but may overpromise for some\nE. Breadth/learning angle—reinforces important technical depth\n\nStep 5C: Choose strongest direction and write hook\nDirection A (User’s own phrasing) has the clearest value/hook and literal match—“30 AI Projects You Can Build This Weekend (Free Guide)”\n\nStep 6: Full Draft\n30 AI Projects You Can Build This Weekend (Free Guide)\n\nIf you want to level up as an AI builder, you need hands-on projects—and not just with the latest GenAI tools.\n\nI put together a list of 30 project ideas you can actually finish in a weekend.\n\nThey cover the full stack:\n• Software 1.0 – Data pipelines, scraping, and analysis projects\n• Software 2.0 – Classic ML and deep learning models\n• Software 3.0 – Prompt engineering, RAG, agent automation, and fine-tuning\n\nYou’ll find ideas for:\n- Scraping and visualizing real-world data\n- Building your first classifier\n- Experimenting with LLMs and setting up your own AI chatbot\n\nEvery project is practical, with no filler or hype—and every one builds real skills.\n\nGrab the free guide here: [link]\n\n👉 What’s one AI project idea you’d add to this list?\n\nStep 7: Review\n- No business clichés or motivational language\n- Factual, practical, includes technical details\n- Hoover white space and bulleted lists\n- Clear, direct, action-oriented CTA\n- Hook matches user language\n\nStep 8: Write the final post",
