  "input": "Share blog: Local LLM fine-tuning on Mac\n\nContext:\nThis article is part of a larger series on using large language models (LLMs) in practice. In a previous post, I showed how to fine-tune an LLM using a single (free) GPU on Google Colab. While that example (and many others) readily runs on Nvidia hardware, they are not easily adapted to M-series Macs. In this article, I walk through an easy way to fine-tune an LLM locally on a Mac.",
  "writing_steps": "Step 1: \nPurpose: Educate, share new article, and help others run local LLM fine-tuning on Mac machines. \nTarget audience: Practitioners, developers, and experimenters trying to use LLMs on Apple M-series machines, likely familiar with basic ML workflows and interested in portable/dev-friendly solutions.\n\nStep 2 (Wireframe):\n[Hook: Call out the common roadblock of running LLM fine-tuning on Mac vs. Nvidia]\n[Body: Recap previous post (Colab/Nvidia GPU easy), problem (Macs left out), practical solution, quick summary of what's in the new article, and why it's useful]\n[CTA: Ask about reader experiences with Mac LLM workflows]\n[Link to blog early]\n\nStep 3 (Body):\n- Many LLM fine-tuning tutorials are Nvidia/Colab-centric\n- M-series Macs can run ML workloads well, but friction is high for anything not pre-built for Nvidia\n- This article is a step-by-step guide to run LLM fine-tuning locally on a Mac‚Äîwithout needing cloud GPUs\n- Share a link to the article\n\nStep 4 (CTA):\nWhat‚Äôs been your experience running LLM workflows on M-series Macs?\n\nStep 5A (Hook Direction Brainstorm):\n1. [Problem/Solution]: ‚ÄúMost LLM fine-tuning guides skip M-series Macs. Here‚Äôs a simple fix.‚Äù\n2. [Beginner-to-expert clarity]: ‚ÄúFine-tuning LLMs on Google Colab was easy... but what about M-series Macs?‚Äù\n3. [Trend/urgency]: ‚ÄúMore AI devs are switching to Mac. Here‚Äôs how to run LLM fine-tuning locally.‚Äù\n4. [User‚Äôs original phrasing]: ‚ÄúLocal LLM fine-tuning on Mac‚Äù\n\nStep 5B (Add notes):\n1. Problem/solution: Emphasize the friction and the benefit of new guide\n2. Beginner-expert: Use the journey from Colab/Nvidia to Mac as a narrative\n3. Trend: Apple's hardware gaining ground for ML\n4. User‚Äôs own: Simple and direct\n\nStep 5C (Choose strongest and write hook):\n‚ÄúMost LLM fine-tuning guides need Nvidia GPUs‚Äîbut what if you only have a Mac?‚Äù\n\nStep 6 (Full draft):\nMost LLM fine-tuning guides need Nvidia GPUs‚Äîbut what if you only have a Mac?\n\nMy latest article breaks down a straightforward process to fine-tune large language models *locally* on an Apple M-series Mac‚Äîeven if you‚Äôve struggled to get ML code running off-the-shelf.\n\nThis builds on my previous tutorial (which used Google Colab and Nvidia hardware), but this time is 100% local‚Äîno cloud, no extra cost.\n\nüìù Read the full guide:\n[link to blog]\n\nWhat‚Äôs been your experience running LLM workflows on M-series Macs?\n\nStep 7 (Review):\n- Only one em dash in the opening line (acceptable)\n- No repeated words/phrases\n- No fabricated experience, only referencing post series and the blog\n- White space and bullets for scannability\n- Direct, explanatory, and practical style per Shaw‚Äôs example posts\n- No motivational/reflective language\n- CTA is specific and technical\n- Simple, literal language\n\nStep 8 (Final post):",
