  "writing_steps": "Step 1:\n- Purpose: Educate readers on the evolving definitions of \"AI\" by breaking it down into 3 concrete types of software. \n- Target audience: Anyone interested in AI, especially those confused by the different uses/meanings of \"AI\" in tech, business, or mainstream conversations.\n\nStep 2 (Wireframe):\n[Hook: Factual/curiosity-driven statement on AI's confusion]\n[Body: Briefly describe each of the 3 types: 1.0 (rules), 2.0 (ML), 3.0 (LLMs)]\n[Call to action: Invite readers to add other distinctions or share confusion they've seen]\n\nStep 3 (Meat/Body):\n\n“AI” means different things depending on who you ask. Here’s a simple way to break down the kinds of “AI” you’ll see in practice:\n\n• Software 1.0 — Rule-based systems. Think classic “if-then” logic. Everything is manually coded and deterministic. Example: A spam filter that blocks emails if they contain certain words.\n\n• Software 2.0 — Machine learning. Instead of rules, the system finds statistical patterns in data. Code is “written” by training on labeled examples. Example: Image classifiers, recommendation engines.\n\n• Software 3.0 — Large language models. These systems don’t just follow rules or patterns—they generate language, code, and more using massive neural networks (often trained on the open web). Example: ChatGPT, code generation APIs.\n\nStep 4 (CTA):\nWhat confusion about “AI” have you seen recently—anything to add to this list?\n\nStep 5A (Hook Directions):\n1. [User’s own phrasing] “A problem with AI today is that it means different things to different people.”\n2. [Problem/solution] “AI isn’t one thing. Here’s the 3 types you’ll actually encounter.”\n3. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “Most ‘AI’ isn’t what you think. Here’s a quick breakdown of where the term gets messy.”\n4. [Trend/urgency] “As AI takes over the news, most people miss the fact that not all ‘AI’ is built the same.”\n\nStep 5B (Short notes):\n1. Direct from user, centers confusion.\n2. Frame as a practical explanation/solution to confusion.\n3. Exposes misconceptions with a simple framework.\n4. Leans into current events, links to news coverage or regular confusion.\n\nStep 5C (Strongest Direction):\nGo with [Beginner-to-expert clarity]: “Most ‘AI’ isn’t what you think. Here’s a quick breakdown of where the term gets messy.” because it sets up the practical/educational body directly and fits Shaw’s factual, approachable tone.\n\nFinal hook:\n'AI' isn't one thing. Here are 3 types of 'AI software' you’ll actually encounter—and how they’re different.\n\nStep 6 (Draft post):\n'AI' isn't one thing. Here are 3 types of 'AI software' you’ll actually encounter—and how they’re different.\n\nAI gets confusing fast because it means different things to different people. Here’s a practical breakdown:\n\n• Software 1.0 — Rule-based systems. Think classic “if-then” logic. Everything is manually coded and deterministic. Example: Spam filters that block emails with certain words.\n\n• Software 2.0 — Machine learning. Here, the system finds statistical patterns in data. The “rules” are learned from labeled examples—not hardcoded. Example: Image classifiers, recommendation engines.\n\n• Software 3.0 — Large language models (LLMs). Instead of just repeating patterns, these models generate language and code using massive neural networks trained on internet-scale data. Example: ChatGPT.\n\nEach of these gets called \"AI\"—but they work in fundamentally different ways.\n\nWhat’s one misconception about AI software you’ve seen lately?\n\nStep 7 (Review):\n- Voice is clear, technical, and welcoming.\n- No business/AI clichés, motivational language, or idioms. \n- One em-dash only (‘—’), used for bullet clarity.\n- CTA invites only a SINGLE practical/factual response (“What’s one misconception about AI software you’ve seen lately?”)\n- Structure/format matches Shaw’s style (see Example 1/4/5)\n\nStep 8 (Final post):",
