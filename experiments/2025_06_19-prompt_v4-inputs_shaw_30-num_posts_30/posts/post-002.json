  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose and Audience\n- Purpose: Educate, share practical AI principles as lessons learned.\n- Audience: Early-career AI engineers, aspiring practitioners, possibly students or tech professionals considering AI projects.\n\nStep 2: Post Wireframe\n- Hook: (Tease \"what I wish I'd known\")\n- Body: 5 AI principles, each with a 1-sentence expansion for clarity/practicality\n- CTA: What principle would you add?\n\nStep 3: Body\nAt 29, here are the AI principles I wish I'd understood at 24:\n\n1. Don’t just “use AI”—start with the real problem. Building with the latest model or tool doesn’t matter if it’s not solving anything useful.\n2. Focus on the problem, not the technology. Obsess over what needs fixing, not whether you get to use some fancy transformer. \n3. Spend way more time on data curation. The quality and organization of your data makes or breaks most projects (far more than your model choice).\n4. Data quality is more important than data quantity. A small, well-curated dataset beats a massive one full of noise and errors.\n5. Run experiments. Test small, iterate fast, don’t theorize forever. You learn more from trying things out than overthinking architecture.\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhat would you add to this list for someone starting out in AI?\n\nStep 5: Hook\n5A - Directions:\n- [User’s phrasing] “AI principles I know at 29, I wish I had known at 24.”\n- [Problem/Solution] Most AI beginners chase models—here’s what actually matters.\n- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] What I wish someone had told me before I built my first real AI project.\n- [Personal story] Lessons I wish I could send my 24-year-old self about building with AI.\n5B - Notes:\n- [User’s phrasing] direct, curiosity-driven, chronological\n- [Problem/Solution] The mistake of chasing new tech vs. problem-solving\n- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] Could be “Avoid these mistakes in your first 2 years”\n- [Personal story] Sets up credibility—“if I could do it over again”\n5C - Chosen direction: User’s phrasing is strongest and fits Shaw’s style; short, direct, curiosity-driven.\n\nStep 6: Draft\nAI principles I know at 29, I wish I had known at 24.\n\nIf you’re just getting into AI, these are 5 things that would have saved me a lot of wasted effort:\n\n1. Don’t just “use AI”—start with a real problem. Obsess over what actually needs fixing or automating.\n2. Forget the technology for a minute and focus on the problem. The solution comes from understanding the pain point, not chasing the latest model.\n3. Spend more time on data curation than you think is necessary. Good data trumps fancy models, every time.\n4. Data quality beats data quantity. A clean, small dataset is more valuable than a giant, messy one.\n5. Run experiments—fast. Build, test, and iterate instead of debating ideas or architectures for weeks.\n\nWhat would you add to this list for someone starting out in AI?\n\nStep 7: Review\n- Tone matches Shaw: direct, clear, educational, actionable.\n- No cliches or motivational language.\n- No rhetorical opener. Factual, curiosity-driven open.\n- Each bullet expands on the principle with a clear, practical insight.\n- CTA is literal and focused.\n- No more than one em dash.\n\nStep 8: Final Post\n",

Don’t just “use AI”—start with a real problem. Building tech for its own sake rarely works out.\n2. Focus on problems, not technology. The impact is in understanding what actually needs fixing.\n3. Spend more time curating your data. Most projects are won or lost here—not in model selection.\n4. Data quality matters more than data quantity. A small, clean dataset beats a massive, messy one.\n5. Run experiments. Test ideas quickly and iterate instead of theorizing endlessly.\n\nWhat would you add to this list for someone starting out in AI?"
