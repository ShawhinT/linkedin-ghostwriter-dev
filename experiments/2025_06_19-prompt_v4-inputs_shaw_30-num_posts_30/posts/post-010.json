  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Educate/remind audience about the real value of growth and persistence, centering learning as the core asset, not money. \n- Audience: Broad, but especially entrepreneurial audiences and lifelong learners—people focusing on skill development, mindsets, and tangible progress.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\nHook: Money in the bank is not your greatest asset.\nBody: Briefly contrast financial wealth with the benefits of continual learning and mental capital. Share one or two practical ways to “add” to your mental bank account. \nCTA: What’s one skill or habit you’re working to build this year?\n\nStep 3: Write the Body\nToo often, “being rich” sounds like a fixed number in a bank account. \nBut the most valuable asset you can grow is knowledge and skillset: \n- No one can take your learning away from you\n- It compounds over time, multiplying your options\n- You can’t lose it in a downturn or a failed project\n\nSimple ways I try to grow my own “mental balance sheet”: \n1. Choose one skill to go deep on each quarter—right now, it’s [insert example, e.g., prompt engineering or Python automation]\n2. Block time each week (even just 30 minutes) to study, practice, or build a mini-project\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhat’s one skill or habit you’re working to build this year?\n\nStep 5A: Hook Directions\n1. [User’s own phrasing] “Being rich isn't about what's in your bank account, but what's in your mind.”\n2. [Problem/Solution] Money can disappear. Knowledge can’t be taken from you.\n3. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] Most people treat money as the goal—they’re missing a better way to measure progress.\n4. [Results/outcomes] Every new skill you build is worth more than a paycheck.\n\nStep 5B: Notes\n1. User phrasing is strong, literal, and a direct reframing.\n2. Stress the permanence and compounding nature of mental assets.\n3. Challenge the reader's metric for 'rich'.\n4. Illustrate that skill-building directly affects future earnings and stability.\n\nStep 5C: Choose Hook\nI’ll use the user’s own phrasing as it’s concise, strong, and on-theme for Shaw.\n\nStep 6: Full Draft\nBeing rich isn’t about what’s in your bank account, but what’s in your mind.\n\nMoney can disappear. Skills, once learned, stick with you your entire life.\n\nHere are two ways I try to add to my “mental bank account”:\n- Pick a skill each quarter and go deep (right now, mine is [insert example])\n- Block just 30 minutes a week to practice or build something new\n\nYear after year, this compounds.\n\nWhat’s one skill or habit you’re working to build this year?\n\nStep 7: Review\n- Only use one em dash (OK)\n- No repeated phrases \n- No rhetorical opener\n- Body is practical; not motivational\n- CTA is specific and skill-focused \n- Voice matches Shaw’s: honest, expert, action-oriented\n- No business clichés\n- Clear, direct, educational, with a practical application\n\nStep 8: Final Post",
  "final_post": "Being rich isn’t about what’s in your bank account, but what’s in your mind.\n\nMoney will come and go—but every skill you build stays with you and multiplies your options for the future.\n\nHere are two practical ways I work on my “mental bank account”:\n- Choose one skill to go deep on each quarter (right now, mine is [insert your example here])\n- Block 30 minutes per week to learn, practice, or build something new\n\nYear after year, this compounding approach adds up.\n\nWhat’s one skill or habit you’re focusing on right now?"
