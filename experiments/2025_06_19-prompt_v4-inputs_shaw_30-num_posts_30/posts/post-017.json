  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose and Audience\n- Purpose: Practical education—share Shaw's tech stack and offer a transparent, real-world reference for other AI builders. \n- Audience: AI practitioners, technical learners, solo founders, and others researching tools for their own stacks.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n[Curiosity-driven hook (why tech stack posts matter)]\n[List of tools—simple with quick context for each]\n[Direct CTA: What are people using that isn't on this list?]\n\nStep 3: The meat\n- Bulletproof list of my current 2025 AI / ML stack, with a one-sentence context for each:\n  • Python: My primary language for all prototyping and production ML\n  • Jupyter Lab: For fast experimentation and data analysis\n  • Cursor: My main IDE for development (with built-in AI features)\n  • ChatGPT: For brainstorming, code review, and first drafts\n  • OpenAI API: LLM endpoints powering products and prototypes\n  • Hugging Face: Go-to for models, datasets, and pipelines\n  • Sentence Transformers: Most reliable for quick embeddings\n  • GitHub: All code/version control and project tracking\n\nStep 4: CTA\n- What are you using that isn’t on my list?\n\nStep 5: Hook brainstorming\nA. [User’s own phrasing] “My 2025 AI Tech Stack”\nB. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “Tool lists are everywhere, but here’s what I actually use for day-to-day AI projects”\nC. [Trend/urgency] “2025 is shaping up to be a big year for AI tools. Here’s what made the cut for my workflow”\nD. [Problem/solution] “Choosing the right tools can be overwhelming. Here’s my current tech stack for AI work in 2025”\nE. [Numbers] “8 tools I use every week as an AI educator and builder”\n\nHook choice: Option B is strongest for Shaw’s voice and this post. It grounds the post as a real, daily stack—not hype, just what actually gets used.\n\nDraft Hook: Tool lists are everywhere, but here’s what I actually use for day-to-day AI work.\n\nStep 6: Draft of the full post\nTool lists are everywhere, but here’s what I actually use for day-to-day AI work.\n\nIn 2025, my AI tech stack looks like this:\n\n• Python — My main language for everything AI/ML\n• Jupyter Lab — For quick experiments and data analysis\n• Cursor — My go-to IDE, especially with AI integration\n• ChatGPT — For brainstorming, debugging, and quick research\n• OpenAI API — How I run LLMs in real products and prototypes\n• Hugging Face — My source for models and datasets\n• Sentence Transformers — Fast, reliable embeddings\n• GitHub — Where all my code lives, versioned and tracked\n\nWhat are you using right now that’s not on this list?\n\nStep 7: Style, voice, and flow check\n- No clichés or figurative language\n- Factual, clear, concise: check\n- No repeated phrasing or numbers up top\n- Flows naturally, matches Example 5’s style\n- One direct CTA, factual and practical\n- Single em dash used correctly\n\nStep 8: Final post",
