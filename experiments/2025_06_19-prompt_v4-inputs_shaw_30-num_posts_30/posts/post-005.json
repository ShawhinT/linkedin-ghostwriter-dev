But here’s a simple starter workflow that works for most text-based agents:\n\n1. **Define a goal**: Pick a simple task (summarize text, answer a question, write an email).\n2. **Choose a language model**: Use OpenAI’s GPT-3.5/4 or similar (via API).\n3. **Set up your environment**: Python is easiest, but other languages work too (I recommend Jupyter for fast iteration).\n4. **Send input and handle output**: Write a single function that sends your task prompt to the model, and displays the output. No fancy chains or memory just yet.\n5. **Test**: Try it with several different inputs and see how the agent performs. Tweak your prompt or logic as needed.\n\nOnce you’re comfortable, you can move into frameworks like LangChain or build more advanced behaviors.\n\nWhat’s your favorite framework or tool for building beginner-friendly agents?\n\n**Step 7: Style, Voice, and Flow Review**\n- Factual, plain, no motivational language.\n- No repeated words/numbers in hook.\n- Literal language.\n- Single, practical CTA.\n- Matches Shaw’s voice and technical, approachable style.\n- Stepwise, scannable format, matches example posts.\n\n**Step 8: Final Post**",
