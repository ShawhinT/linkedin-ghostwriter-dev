  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose and Audience\n- Purpose: Celebrate a milestone (60k YouTube subscribers), highlight lessons learned about learning and communication, and educate peers/readers through practical insights.\n- Target audience: Fellow creators, educators, entrepreneurs interested in YouTube/content growth, and Shaw’s network who are interested in educational approaches.\n\nStep 2: Post Wireframe\n- Hook: Concrete milestone and what it reveals about learning/communication.\n- Body: Acknowledgment of milestone + 2-3 practical lessons learned about learning and communication via YouTube.\n- CTA: Ask others for an actionable tip or their biggest challenge in communicating educational content.\n\nStep 3: The Body\n- Reached 60k subscribers on YouTube—thank you to everyone who’s followed the journey.\n- Biggest lessons:\n   1. Clear communication > advanced knowledge. Breaking complex ideas down simply is more important than showing off expertise.\n   2. Feedback from viewers is the fastest way to improve. Reading comments and DMs is key to iterating on teaching style.\n   3. Experimentation is necessary. Trying new formats, examples, or visuals leads to better explanations over time.\n\nStep 4: CTA\n- What’s one tip you’d share for teaching technical topics online?\n\nStep 5: Hooks (Step 5A/B/C)\nA. [Milestone-first] “60,000 people have joined my YouTube channel to learn about AI and tech.”\nB. [Learning & communication angle] “Every new subscriber on YouTube has taught me something about clear communication.”\nC. [Process eye] “Communicating complex topics is harder than it looks—here are 3 lessons from 60k subs.”\nD. [User’s own phrasing] “Milestone post: hitting 60k subs on YouTube. Why: learning and communication.”\n\nStep 5B: Key points for each\nA. Milestone + scale\nB. What Shaw learned as an educator\nC. Practical, bite-sized takeaways\nD. User’s language (literal and direct)\n\nStep 5C: Choose \"C\"—most actionable, direct, and fits Shaw’s style best.\n\nStep 6: Full Draft\nCommunicating complex topics is harder than it looks—here are 3 lessons from 60k subs on YouTube.\n\nJust crossed 60,000 subscribers. I started the channel to share what I was learning in AI, but the real challenge (and fun) turned out to be communicating clearly.\n\nHere are the most important things I’ve learned so far:\n\n1. Clear explanation beats technical depth. Simple visuals and step-by-step reasoning make videos more impactful than showing off advanced skills.\n2. Feedback is a superpower. Viewer comments and questions are the fastest way to improve how I teach and what I cover next.\n3. Try new formats—even short sketches or analogies can make a big difference in how complex topics land.\n\nWhat’s one tip you’ve learned for teaching technical topics online?\n\nStep 7: Review for Style, Voice, Flow\n- Em dash limit: Only one at the start. No motivational language or business clichés. CTA is focused. Literal, stepwise reflection. Flows like Shaw’s milestone/lessons posts. Cross-checked examples: Example 2 and Example 3 tightly match this format. No idioms, tricolons, or general reflection prompts.\n\nStep 8: Final Post\n\n",
