  "writing_steps": "Step 1: \n- Purpose: To show concrete numbers, share milestones, and educate on the sources of income that contributed to a $10k month after a period of failures. The deeper lesson: break down how real creators make it (not just with a single “win,” but with a mix of income streams).\n- Target audience: Aspiring AI solopreneurs, educators, content creators—those working toward financial independence with real skills, and/or considering leaving a job to build their own path.\n\nStep 2: Post wireframe\n[Hook: Clear statement about the 15-month struggle and finally hitting a $10k+ month]\n[Breakdown: Literal numbers for each stream]\n[Lesson: Concrete takeaway—diversified streams, not one ‘big break’]\n[CTA: What income stream would you like to learn more about?]\n\nStep 3: Meat\nAfter leaving my job, I didn’t hit success right away. I failed for 15 months. It took a mix of different income streams to finally break $10k in one month:\n- AI Builders Bootcamp: $9,265.48\n- Medium (blog): $894.52\n- YouTube: $542.73\n- Consulting calls: $363.21\nTotal: $10,826.72\nIt didn’t come from a viral video or any single source. The lesson: creator income adds up from many places—building multiple steady streams matters more than chasing a single jackpot.\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhich of these income streams do you want a breakdown of next?\n\nStep 5: Hook\nBrainstormed directions:\n- [User’s own phrasing]: “Leaving my job and failing for 15 months. Finally hitting $10k in one month.”\n- [Problem/solution]: Most creators think one channel is the answer. What the real month looked like (with numbers).\n- [Personal story]: 15 months without wins—then a $10k month. Here is the real breakdown.\n- [Results]: This is exactly how I hit $10,826.72 after 15 months of failures.\n- [Trend/urgency]: Building in public—why diversified income is real creator strategy now.\n\nStrongest: Direct personal journey + concrete earnings. The result angle fits the user’s notes perfectly. Keep it literal: “15 months of failures. Then a $10,826.72 month. Here’s the breakdown.”\n\nStep 6: Draft full post\n15 months of failures. Then a $10,826.72 month.\n\nAfter I left my job, it didn’t click right away. I didn’t find the right offer or audience in the first few tries.\n\nTo finally cross $10k, here’s where the money came from:\n- AI Builders Bootcamp: $9,265.48\n- Medium (blog): $894.52\n- YouTube: $542.73\n- Consulting calls: $363.21\nTotal: $10,826.72\nThis wasn’t about one big launch, viral moment, or major client. It was the sum of small wins across multiple channels.\n\nIf you want to make it as a solopreneur or creator, I think focusing on several income streams is more practical than betting everything on one platform or product.\n\nWhich of these streams do you want a breakdown of next?\n\nStep 7: Review\n- Only one em dash, used to clarify chronological gap. Style is consistent and factual.\n- No metaphors, clichés, or tricolons.\n- Direct, practical, and includes numbers.\n- Single clear CTA.\n- Matches the structure and tone in example posts 2 and 3.\n\nStep 8: Write the final post.",
