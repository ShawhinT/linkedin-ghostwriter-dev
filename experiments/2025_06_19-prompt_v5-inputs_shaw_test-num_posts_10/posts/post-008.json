  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose and Audience\n- Purpose: Share a breakdown of key skills needed (from Shaw's perspective) to become a (data) entrepreneur. Provide an actionable and transparent checklist drawn from personal experience to help aspiring entrepreneurs see what to focus on.\n- Audience: Aspiring data entrepreneurs, technical freelancers, and anyone exploring solopreneurship in the tech/AI space.\n\nStep 2: Post Wireframe\n[Hook: Factual insight about how being a data entrepreneur demands more than technical skills]\n[Body: Bullet-point list of 15 skills/realizations necessary, as observed by Shaw]\n[1-Sentence observation about the nature of the skillset: Can't rely on code alone, need multiple overlapping, often uncomfortable skills]\n[CTA: What would you add to this list?]\n\nStep 3: Body\n- I had to learn these 15 things to go from a technical contributor to a (data) entrepreneur:\n  1. Identify pain points\n  2. Code beyond notebooks\n  3. Use AI tools effectively (not just play with demos)\n  4. Sell a solution (not just build it)\n  5. Talk to clients (in plain language)\n  6. Write well (emails, sales pages, docs)\n  7. Make a simple website\n  8. Produce content (social, docs, videos)\n  9. Cold outbound (not just wait for inbound)\n  10. Post consistently (even if nobody reacts)\n  11. Get comfortable looking foolish\n  12. Learn fast—then discard what doesn’t work\n- This is not a complete list, but it’s what keeps coming up for me. The non-technical skills matter just as much as the technical ones.\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhat would you add to this list?\n\nStep 5: Hook Brainstorming\nA) [Problem/solution] Most technical founders only focus on code—but there’s a bigger list.\nB) [Personal confession] I needed far more than just coding to build my first data venture.\nC) [Beginner/expert] 15 skills you actually need to start a data business (it’s not all coding).\nD) [Numbers] 15 things nobody told me would matter when launching as a data entrepreneur.\nE) [User phrasing] 15 things I had to learn to become a (data) entrepreneur.\n\nStep 5B: Notes\nA) Most people stop at tech. This draws attention to what they’re missing.\nB) Makes it feel personal. Honest learning journey.\nC) Invites people to realize which skills they lack.\nD) Brings curiosity for the numbered list.\nE) Direct, from user input.\n\nStep 5C: Select final hook.\n“15 things I had to learn to become a (data) entrepreneur.” This is direct, matches user phrasing, and sets up an honest thread.\n\nStep 6: Draft full post\n[Hook]\n15 things I had to learn to become a (data) entrepreneur\n\n[Body]\nMost technical people think coding will get them all the way. But running a (data) business demands skills that don’t come up in most technical jobs.\n\nHere are the big ones I had to learn (and still use every day):\n\n- Identify pain points\n- Code beyond notebooks\n- Use AI tools effectively (beyond demos)\n- Sell your solution (not just build it)\n- Talk with clients in plain language\n- Write clear emails, docs, and landing pages\n- Build a basic website\n- Make useful content (social, docs, videos)\n- Cold outbound (don’t wait for leads)\n- Post consistently (engagement doesn’t matter at first)\n- Be willing to look foolish\n- Always learn and discard what doesn’t work\n\nTechnical skills matter. But so do non-technical ones—and most of them feel uncomfortable the first time.\n\n[CTA]\nWhat would you add to this list?\n\nStep 7: Style and Flow Review\n- No em dash overuse (only one, justified as a pause for emphasis near the end)\n- No metaphors or business clichés\n- CTA is focused and actionable\n- Follows Shaw’s factual, educational tone\n- Direct use of user language\n\nStep 8: Final Post",
