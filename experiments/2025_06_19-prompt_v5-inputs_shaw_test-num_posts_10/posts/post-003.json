  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose and Audience\n- Purpose: Promote an educational blog post with a practical technical walkthrough.\n- Target Audience: AI/ML engineers, developers, and technical practitioners interested in deploying machine learning models.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n- Hook: Factual statement about deploying ML models\n- Body: Practical summary of what readers will learn—technologies used and the value of the walkthrough\n- CTA: Invite technical questions or additional stack recommendations\n- Link: Place link before CTA\n\nStep 3: Body\nIf you're deploying ML models, moving beyond notebooks is essential. This post shares the stepwise process for packaging and deploying ML solutions using FastAPI, Docker, and GCP. It covers setting up FastAPI endpoints, containerizing your app with Docker, and deploying to Google Cloud Platform. All steps are included, from development to cloud deployment, for a reproducible workflow.\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhat tools or platforms have you used to deploy your ML projects?\n\nStep 5: Hooks (3–5 directions)\n1. [Problem/solution] \"Deploying ML models takes more than a notebook—here’s a stepwise walkthrough.\"\n2. [Results] \"Want to deploy ML models with FastAPI, Docker, and GCP? Here’s how in one guide.\"\n3. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] \"Deploying ML models is easier when you have a clear workflow.\"\n4. [Trend/urgency] \"Production ML deployments are moving to Docker and GCP. Learn it step by step.\"\n5. [User’s input as hook] \"How to Deploy ML Solutions with FastAPI, Docker, and GCP (link below).\"\n\nNotes: The strongest direction is [Problem/solution] because it explains why this matters for engineers moving beyond experimentation.\n\nStep 6: Full Draft\nDeploying ML models takes more than a notebook—here’s a stepwise walkthrough.\n\nI just published a blog post showing exactly how to deploy machine learning solutions with FastAPI, Docker, and GCP.\n\nThis guide covers:\n- Building your FastAPI endpoint\n- Containerizing it with Docker\n- Deploying and running it on Google Cloud Platform\n\nAll code and commands are included step by step.\n\nRead the guide here: [blog link]\n\nWhat tools or platforms have you used to deploy your ML projects?\n\nStep 7: Review for style, voice, and flow\n- Factual, clear, practical\n- No em dash (or just one, justified)\n- No business clichés or motivational language\n- CTA is technical/practical\n- No assumptions about Shaw’s personal experience\n- Format uses white space and bullet points\n- Tone matches Example 5, using clear value for engineers/creators\n\nStep 8: Final Post",
