  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Share the practical details of a content creation strategy that resulted in $15,000 (focusing on actionable tactics, not as a motivational outcome)\n- Audience: Other AI entrepreneurs, creators, and freelancers interested in practical content strategies and revenue tips\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n- Hook: Clear, number-focused opener about $15,000 content strategy\n- Meat: Breakdown of main tactics, tools, or steps used to reach $15k\n- CTA: Invite others to share tactics or ask about specific parts of the strategy\n\nStep 3: Body (meat)\n- Summarize the process: What channels did I focus on? What kind of content was produced? What tools/automation helped scale?\n- List main steps or pillars (e.g., topic selection, batching, repurposing, distribution, leveraging AI, tracking results)\n- Emphasize practical, stepwise information or frameworks, not generic advice\n\nStep 4: CTA or question\n- What’s one content tactic that’s driven real revenue for you?\n\nStep 5: Hook Brainstorm\nStep 5A: Labeled directions\n1. [Numbers/results] My $15,000 AI content engine – the exact steps\n2. [Process focus] How to structure an AI-powered content strategy for revenue\n3. [Comparison] Breaking down the content tactics that worked (and what didn’t)\n4. [User’s own phrasing] My $15,000 AI content creation strategy\n\nStep 5B: Notes for each\n1. Numbers always catch attention; use “$15,000” in opening line\n2. Emphasize structure / repeatable process\n3. Adds value (what to skip vs what to do)\n4. Direct and simple, aligns closely with user\n\nStep 5C: Choose hook\n- Go with [Numbers/results] but slightly rephrase for clarity and impact.\n\nStep 6: Draft of full post\n\n---\n\nI built a content engine with AI that generated $15,000 in revenue.\n\nHere’s the exact strategy I used:\n\n1. Picked 2 channels to focus on: LinkedIn and YouTube. Spent 90% of my effort here instead of spreading thin across every platform.\n2. Used AI tools (like GPT-4 and Opus Clip) to draft outlines, scripts, and repurpose long-form content into short posts.\n3. Batched all my work. Instead of daily content grind, set aside 1 day/week to prep everything for the upcoming week.\n4. Prioritized content formats that lead to direct inquiries and product sales (tutorial threads, behind-the-scenes breakdowns, and YouTube demos).\n5. Set up basic tracking—linked every post and video to a landing page or product, measured actual $ from each source.\n\nThis process removed guesswork and let me double down on what actually brought in clients and sales.\n\nWhat’s one content tactic that’s made a direct impact for you?\n\n---\n\nStep 7: Style/voice/flow checklist\n- Em dash: Only one, and used for clarity\n- No metaphors, idioms, business clichés, or hype language\n- Factual, steps-focused breakdown\n- Hook is a factual claim, not motivational or reflective\n- CTA is a single, practical question\n- Matches example posts in tone and format\n\nStep 8: Final post\n\n---",
