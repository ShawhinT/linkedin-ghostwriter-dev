post-004,True,"Step 1: Summarize Shaw's style. Shaw's posts are factual, practical, and educational, often using clear lists or frameworks. He uses a hook-problem-solution structure, avoids idioms, motivational catchphrases, and business jargon, and ends with a factual engagement prompt. Playful or personal openers are rare but possible if the rest of the post is practical and clear.

Step 2: Check for red flags. The post opens with a personal note ('It’s my birthday'), which is not typical but not strictly off-brand. The main body is a factual list of metrics, which is consistent with Shaw's style. The sentence 'I track these numbers to stay honest about progress, not as an end goal.' is factual and not motivational or summarizing. The closing engagement prompt ('What’s your favorite metric for tracking your growth?') is factual and at the end, matching Shaw's typical structure. There are no idioms, business clichés, or motivational punchlines. There is one em-dash, which is acceptable.

Step 3: Weigh red flags against overall structure. The post is practical, clear, and provides context for why the numbers matter. The structure is hook (birthday), observation (metrics), explanation (why track), and engagement prompt. There are no cumulative minor deviations.

Step 4: Cross-reference with examples. Shaw has shared personal milestones and breakdowns (e.g., income, content creation stats) in a similar factual, list-based style. The engagement prompt and explanation are on-brand.

Step 5: Final check. The post is practical, educational, and follows Shaw's structure. The personal opener is not a red flag in this context, as Shaw has occasionally used personal context for factual posts. No red flags or cumulative minor deviations are present."
post-008,True,"Step 1: Summarize Shaw's style from the examples. Shaw's posts are practical, educational, and structured, often using lists or frameworks. He avoids idioms, business clichés, and motivational catchphrases. His posts follow a hook → problem/observation → solution/resource structure, and end with a factual engagement prompt. He uses clear, literal language and rarely uses playful metaphors or emojis.

Step 2: Check for red flags in the post.
- The post uses a list format, which is consistent with Shaw's style.
- The hook is factual and observational: ""Most technical people think coding will get them all the way, but running a data business demands skills you don’t pick up in most technical jobs.""
- The list items are practical and concrete, e.g., ""Identify pain points,"" ""Code beyond notebooks,"" ""Sell your solution.""
- There is one minor deviation: the phrase ""Be willing to look foolish"" is slightly more conversational/motivational than Shaw's typical phrasing, but it is not a cliché or idiom.
- The sentence ""Technical skills matter. But the non-technical ones are just as important, and honestly, most of them felt uncomfortable at first."" is factual and reflective, not motivational or summarizing in a tricolon format.
- The engagement prompt is factual and at the end: ""What would you add to this list?""
- There are no idioms, business clichés, or salesy language.
- There is one em-dash, which is acceptable.

Step 3: Weigh red flags against overall structure and value. The post is practical, educational, and follows Shaw's structure. The minor conversational tone in one bullet does not change the overall feel or clarity of the post.
