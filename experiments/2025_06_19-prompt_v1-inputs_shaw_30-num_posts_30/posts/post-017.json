The target audience is AI learners, fellow developers, technical solopreneurs, and aspiring AI educators.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe: \n[Hook]\n[Shaw's AI stack for 2025, quick commentary on each tool, why he uses themâ€”showing real workflow.]\n[Ask: What tool is missing from this stack?]\n\nStep 3: Body:\nWhen building, learning, and teaching AI in 2025, these are the tools I keep coming back to:\n\n- Python: The backbone of every project. Thereâ€™s no real AI stack without it.\n- Jupyter Lab: My favorite way to tinker and document learning in real time.\n- Cursor: An AI-powered code editor that makes iteration lightning fast.\n- ChatGPT: My brainstorming partner and everyday copilot for debugging and docs.\n- OpenAI API: For quickly deploying LLMs and testing ideas at scale.\n- Hugging Face: Where I discover, share, and fine-tune models and datasets.\n- Sentence Transformers: For tasks like semantic search, embeddings, and custom similarity jobs.\n- GitHub: Still mission control for all code and collaboration.\n\nStep 4: CTA: What tool is missing from this stack?\n\nStep 5: Hook brainstorming\n\n[Problem/solution] Most AI tool lists are either outdated or overly complicatedâ€”hereâ€™s my actual go-to stack for 2025.\n[Personal story] After years of trial and error, hereâ€™s the exact AI stack Iâ€™ll use in 2025 (and why).\n[Trend/urgency] The AI stack is shifting fast. Hereâ€™s what I use every day for real projects.\n[Beginner-to-expert clarity] If youâ€™re just starting out, skip the bloated lists: these 8 tools will get you 90% of the way.\n[Results/outcomes] This stack shipped my last 3 AI projectsâ€”if you want to build faster, start here.\n\nStep 5B: Add notes\n- [Personal story] Years of trial/errorâ€”these made it through.\n- [Trend/urgency] Stack changes fast; hereâ€™s my 2025 update.\n- [Beg/Expert clarity] Overwhelm is realâ€”hereâ€™s the streamlined version.\n\nStep 5C: Final hook (choosing \"Personal story + clarity\"):\nAfter years of trial and error, hereâ€™s the exact AI stack Iâ€™ll use in 2025 (and why every tool earned its spot).\n\nStep 6: Style check: \n- Approachable; lists tools clearly; quick rationale for each.\n- Ends with explicit, focused invitation to reply.\n\nStep 7: Final post.",
