  "input": "A problem with AI today is that it means different things to different people. Share 3 types of software.\n\nSoftware 1.0 = Rule-based systems\nSoftware 2.0 = ML\nSoftware 3.0 = LLMs",
  "writing_steps": "Step 1:\n- Purpose: Educate, clarify confusion about what \"AI\" means today by explaining the evolution of software categories.\n- Audience: Broad tech/interested audience, especially those new to AI or feeling overwhelmed/dazed by AI's changing definitions (students, professionals, founders).\n\nStep 2: Post Wireframe\n[Hook]\n[Body: Explanation of Software 1.0, 2.0, 3.0—with examples, simple definitions, implications]\n[CTA: Focused question to spark reflection or discussion]\n\nStep 3: Body\nAI means wildly different things depending on who you ask. Here’s the simplest way I know to break down the three generations of software:\n\n- Software 1.0 = Rule-based: Think classic \"If X, then Y\" logic. Hard-coded, explicit instructions. Used everywhere from calculators to spreadsheets, and early chatbots. Reliable, but rigid.\n- Software 2.0 = Machine Learning: Here software learns patterns from data, not just rules. These are your image classifiers, recommendation engines, speech recognition—trained on examples, but still narrow.\n- Software 3.0 = Large Language Models: Now we have systems like GPT-4, Claude, Gemini. Instead of just learning from labeled data, they can learn massive general capabilities from text, images, and code. They generate, reason, and solve tasks far beyond what those narrow ML systems could.\n\nEach leap opened up new possibilities but also brings new risks and confusion. Just saying \"AI\" doesn’t tell you which we’re talking about.\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhere do you see the biggest gap between what people *think* AI is, vs. what they’re actually using?\n\nStep 5A: Hook directions\n1. [Problem/solution] \"AI means nothing—and everything. Here’s how I explain the 3 kinds.\"\n2. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] \"Most people lump all ‘AI’ together. That’s a huge mistake.\"\n3. [Results/outcomes] \"Why LLMs are a true leap—you’re using them even if you don’t know it.\"\n4. [Personal story] \"I used to say ‘AI’ back when it just meant rules. Now? Totally different world.\"\n\nStep 5B:\n1. \"Everyone’s confused about AI—here’s my 3-part model.\"\n2. \"Lumping all ‘AI’ together blurs the very real technical differences.\"\n3. \"Software 1.0, 2.0, 3.0—each changed what software can do.\"\n4. \"Sharing my journey from if-then to LLMs.\"\n\nStep 5C: Choose strongest direction (Beginner-to-expert clarity/Problem-solution). Post is about clarifying the spectrum, which most don’t see.\nFinal hook:\n“Most people lump all ‘AI’ into one bucket—and it’s confusing everyone.”\n\nStep 6: Review\n- Clear, readable, friendly tone\n- Explains each software generation plainly\n- Single CTA/question inviting stories and reflection\n\nStep 7: Final post below.",
