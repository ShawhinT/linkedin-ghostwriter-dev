  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose and Audience\n- Purpose: Transparently share the revenue breakdown for Shaw's first $10k month as an entrepreneur. This both educates and inspires other entrepreneurs by demystifying income streams.\n- Audience: Fellow solopreneurs, early-stage entrepreneurs, AI freelancers, and LinkedIn followers curious about digital/AI business models.\n\nStep 2: Turn input into a post wireframe\n- Hook: Call out transparency and a common milestone ($10k month)\n- Meat: Share exact breakdown: list the revenue sources, amounts, percentages, and lessons or surprises from the experience. Add a note on what worked/what didn’t.\n- CTA: Invite reader to share their own main revenue stream right now or ask a specific question about diversification.\n\nStep 3: Write the meat of the post first\nLast month, I hit a milestone I used to daydream about:\n\n$10,143 in a single month as a solo entrepreneur.\n\nHere’s how it broke down:\n\n- AI Consulting (building agents & automation for clients): $4,000\n- Online Course Sales (AI foundations + agent tutorials): $3,600\n- 1:1 Coaching: $1,500\n- Affiliate Revenue (tools I genuinely use): $643\n- YouTube Ad Revenue: $400\n\nA few honest lessons:\n- Consulting was the fastest way to consistent income—but it’s tied to my time\n- Courses & digital products were ‘lumpy’ but higher margin\n- The small streams (affiliate + YouTube) add up over time, but aren’t overnight wins\n- Each stream took trial-and-error to figure out\n\nStep 4: Write the CTA or question\nWhat’s your #1 revenue stream right now?\n\nStep 5: Brainstorm and write the hook\nStep 5A: Labeled directions for hook:\n- [Milestone/Transparency] “I used to dream of my first $10k month. Here’s the exact breakdown.”\n- [Problem/solution] “Sick of vague income claims? Here’s how my real $10k month looked.”\n- [Mythbusting] “Most think $10k/month is impossible solo… Here’s what worked for me.”\n- [Personal] “Full breakdown: where my first $10k as an entrepreneur actually came from.”\n\nStep 5B: Notes on each:\n- Milestone/Transparency: Leans into relatability, key number.\n- Problem/solution: Addresses LinkedIn skepticism of income claims.\n- Mythbusting: Encourages possibility, subtly educates.\n- Personal: Honest, focuses on specifics.\n\nStep 5C: Pick the strongest: Milestone/Transparency is clearest and most authentic.\n\nFinal Hook: ‘Here’s exactly how I made my first $10k month as an entrepreneur (with a revenue breakdown)’\n\nStep 6: Review for Shaw’s style\n- Conversational, humble, transparent\n- Bullet points and short lessons\n- Ends with a single, direct question\n\nStep 7: Final Post:",
  "final_post": "Here’s exactly how I made my first $10k month as an entrepreneur (with a revenue breakdown)\n\nLast month, I hit a milestone I used to daydream about:\n\n$10,143 as a solo founder.\n\nHere’s where every dollar came from:\n\n- AI Consulting (client projects & automations): $4,000\n- Online Course Sales (AI foundations + agent tutorials): $3,600\n- 1:1 Coaching: $1,500\n- Affiliate Revenue (only tools I use): $643\n- YouTube Ad Revenue: $400\n\nA few honest lessons:\n- Consulting was the most reliable (but directly tied to my hours)\n- Courses and products were unpredictable, but much higher margin\n- The “small streams” like affiliate and YouTube took the longest to grow—but they compound\n- None of this happened by accident. Each stream took real trial and error\n\nIf you’re building your own path, just know: $10k is a real milestone—but the fun (and work) is in how you get there.\n\nWhat’s your #1 revenue stream right now?"
