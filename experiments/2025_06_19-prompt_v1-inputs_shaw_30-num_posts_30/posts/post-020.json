  "writing_steps": "Step 1: \n- Purpose: Share learnings from a conversation with a high-earning entrepreneur, inspire and educate other solopreneurs/AI folks with actionable takeaways on leveling up their businesses.\n- Audience: Solopreneurs, consultants, AI builders aspiring to grow their business income (esp. those currently below the $100k/mo level).\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n[Hook: I paid a $100k/mo entrepreneur to talk to me… here’s what I learned.]\n\n[Lessons/Insights: Customer pain > skills, value pricing, pricing/copy correlation, avatar clarity via free content, difference is strategy not just tech]\n\n[CTA: What's ONE takeaway you'd apply to your business?]\n\nStep 3: Body\nEarlier this year I paid (yep, real $) to get an hour of advice from someone making $100,000 per month as a solo founder.\n\nMy honest takeaways:\n- Solve customer pain points, not just show off skills. Clients pay for pain relief—not a skills list.\n- Price your services for value, not for your time. Hourly rates keep you stuck; results-based pricing unlocks scale.\n- If you’re charging high-ticket ($5k+), spend more time writing long-form copy and building the relationship before selling. The bigger the ask, the longer the nurture.\n- Get hyper-clear on your ideal client (avatar) and then attract them with free, useful content.\n- The leap from $10k/mo to $100k/mo is rarely about technical skills—it’s usually about business strategy and packaging.\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhat’s ONE takeaway from this you’d actually apply?\n\nStep 5A: Brainstorm 5 hook directions\n- [Curiosity/social proof]: I paid a $100k/mo entrepreneur to mentor me...\n- [Problem/solution]: Why pricing by the hour keeps you stuck\n- [Personal story]: The biggest mistake I made charging for AI consulting\n- [Results/tease]: 5 lessons that helped me rethink my pricing and business model\n- [Beginner/expert]: Most people stop at technical skills. Here’s what actually gets you to $100k/mo\n\nStep 5B: Note details for each\n- [Curiosity/social proof]: \"Paid $X for advice\" = skin in the game + strong model\n- [Problem/solution]: Hourly kills scale, value pricing is key\n- [Personal story]: Early on, focused on skills not pain points\n- [Results/tease]: “5 lessons” means a concrete list post\n- [Beginner/expert]: Difference at high income = strategy over skills\n\nStep 5C: Pick strongest direction: Curiosity/social proof (\"I paid... here's what I learned\") — hits on skin-in-the-game and aspirational curiosity.\n\nStep 6: Review for style, sequence, and voice\n- Clear, direct, Shaw’s “learning along with you” voice\n- Honest reflection, bullet points, actionable items\n- Ends with a single, focused question\n\nStep 7: Final post below.",
  "final_post": "I paid a $100k/month entrepreneur to mentor me—here’s what I learned.\n\nEarlier this year, I set aside real money for an hour with someone who earns $100k/month as a solo founder. Here are my top takeaways:\n\n- Solve customer pain points, not just show off your skills. People pay for relief, not for a resume.\n- Price for the value you deliver—not your time. Hourly rates keep you stuck; value-based pricing unlocks growth.\n- Higher price tag? Spend more time building trust. The bigger the ask, the more you need to nurture with long-form copy (don’t rush the pitch).\n- Get hyper-clear on your ideal client (your “avatar”), then attract them by sharing free, genuinely useful content.\n- The leap from $10k/month to $100k/month is usually about business strategy—not better tech skills.\n\nOne conversation—worth every dollar. \n\nWhat’s ONE takeaway you’d actually apply to your business?"
