  "writing_steps": "Step 1:\n- Purpose: Share helpful resource (blog) and drive traffic; validate interest in simple Python guides for AI newcomers.\n- Target Audience: People starting out in AI—especially those who don’t have a programming background, but want to get practical with Python.\n\nStep 2 (Wireframe):\n[Engaging hook]\n[Why Python for AI? (context on importance, reassurance)]\n[Quick hint of what's in the blog]\n[Clear CTA to check out the blog]\n\nStep 3 (Body):\nIf you’re just starting in AI, Python can feel overwhelming. But here’s the truth: you don’t need to be a computer scientist to build something useful. In fact, most AI projects only require a few basics to get going.\n\nI put together a beginner-friendly Python QuickStart guide specifically for people learning AI. It covers the essentials—no fluff, no gatekeeping. Just the tools, code, and skills you’ll use right away.\n\nStep 4 (CTA):\nCurious to start building? Check out the full guide here:\n\nStep 5 (Hooks—brainstorming directions):\n[Problem/solution] — \"Feel lost with Python? Here's your shortcut.\"\n[Personal story] — \"I struggled with Python for months—here’s the simple approach I wish I had.\"\n[Clarity] — \"You don’t need a CS degree to start coding AI.\"\n[Outcome] — \"The fastest way to get from AI zero to building projects.\"\n[Trend/urgency] — \"With AI moving fast, practical Python skills are crucial. Here’s how to catch up.\"\n\nNotes:\n- Highlight how this is for people without programming backgrounds\n- Emphasize simplicity and immediate usefulness\n- Avoid hyping or over-promising\n\nStep 6 (Review):\n- I want the hook to set up accessibility and reassurance.\n- The body clarifies what the blog delivers — actionable basics for AI learners.\n- CTA is direct, single focus.\n- Voice: friendly, practical, peer mentor.\n\nStep 7 (Final post assembly):",
  "final_post": "You don’t need a computer science degree to build with AI—just a beginner’s mindset and the right tools.\n\nIf you’re new to AI and Python feels overwhelming, you’re not alone. Most useful AI projects only need a handful of Python basics—not endless theory or complex code.\n\nI wrote a practical Python QuickStart for people exactly like you: AI learners who want to build things, not just watch tutorials. It’s all about the essentials—simple code, real use cases, no jargon. \n\nCurious to start building? Here’s the full guide:\n\n[link to blog]"
