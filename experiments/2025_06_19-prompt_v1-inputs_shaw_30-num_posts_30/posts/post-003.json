  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose and Audience\n- Purpose: Motivate and demystify the AI engineering process, encourage followers to take action by building, and position Shaw as an accessible mentor.\n- Audience: Aspiring AI engineers, self-taught devs, career switchers, and curious builders in the tech/AI space.\n\nStep 2: Post Wireframe\n[Hook]\n[Body: Relatable truth about \"top\" AI engineers, breaking the myth of innate brilliance. Real value comes from building, not just reading or watching. Why building compounds skills/knowledge. Perhaps a nudge that small projects matter.]\n[Focused single CTA: Simple question like: What will you build next?]\n\nStep 3: The meat of the post\nMost people assume top AI engineers are geniuses. But here’s the reality: they’ve just shipped more projects than everyone else. \n\nIt’s not about reading another research paper or watching a dozen tutorials.\nIt’s about opening your code editor, picking a problem (no matter how small), and building a solution.\n\nEvery project—good or bad—teaches you something you can’t get from theory. Your skills stack with every prototype, demo, and experiment you attempt. That’s the real superpower.\n\nThe faster you move from “learning” to “building,” the faster you grow.\n\nStep 4: The CTA\nWhat’s the next AI project you want to build?\n\nStep 5: Hooks (Explore 3-5 directions)\n1. [Myth-Busting/Beginner-to-Expert Clarification]: Everyone thinks top AI engineers are way smarter…\n- Note: Break the myth of 'genius' in AI.\n2. [Personal Story]: Early in my AI journey, I thought I needed more tutorials, but my biggest jumps came from building...\n- Note: Show learning > doing.\n3. [Call to Action/Challenge]: Most people don’t realize the #1 skill that sets apart elite AI engineers—action.\n4. [Juicy Language]: The secret weapon of top AI engineers (and it’s not intelligence)\n- Note: Imply a simple, actionable secret.\n\nStep 5C: Choose the strongest hook direction\nDirection 1 feels relatable and disarming—let’s bust the genius myth.\n\nStep 6: Review for fit\n- Tone is accessible, honest, direct, motivational.\n- Invites action (not just passive consumption).\n- Clean CTA.\n\nStep 7: Write the final post",
  "final_post": "Most people think top AI engineers are just… smarter than the rest of us.\n\nBut here’s the real secret: they just build more projects.\n\nIt’s not about reading every research paper, or watching every tutorial.\nIt’s about picking a problem—any problem, big or small—and building something to solve it.\n\nEvery wonky prototype or half-finished demo teaches you more than another hour of passive learning.\nYour skills compound with every project you ship.\n\nWant to level up? Start building. That’s how the best get better.\n\nWhat’s the next AI project you want to build?"
