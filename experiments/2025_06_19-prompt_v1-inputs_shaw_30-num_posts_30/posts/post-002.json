  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose and Audience\n- Purpose: Share practical career lessons about AI to help others avoid common mistakes and focus on what matters. Inspire and educate with a 'learn from my experience' angle.\n- Audience: Early-career technologists, AI enthusiasts, and fellow entrepreneurs—especially those who are just starting out.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n[Engaging hook about lessons learned with hindsight or things I wish I knew]\n[5 practical lessons, each with a short explanation—no fluff]\n[CTA: What's one lesson you wish you had learned sooner?]\n\nStep 3: Meat of the Post\nAt 24, I was fascinated by AI tools, chasing the latest frameworks and models. Five years later, here’s what I wish I’d focused on instead:\n\n- Don’t use AI just to use AI. If you can solve the problem without it, do that. Simpler is almost always better.\n- Focus on problems, not technology. The best projects start with real needs, not shiny tools.\n- Invest (way) more time curating your data. Good data is the backbone of effective AI.\n- Data quality beats data quantity, every time. One clean dataset will outperform mountains of messy data.\n- Run small experiments constantly. Test ideas quickly—you’ll learn more in weeks than months theorizing.\n\nStep 4: CTA/Question\nWhat’s one lesson you wish you learned earlier in your AI journey?\n\nStep 5: Hooks Brainstorm\nA. [Hindsight/Regret] \"What I wish I knew about AI in my early 20s.\"\nB. [Listicle/Nuggets] \"5 hard-learned AI truths from 5 years in the field.\"\nC. [Personal story] \"At 24, I thought AI was all about flashy models—I was wrong.\"\nD. [Problem/solution] \"Avoid these beginner traps if you’re diving into AI.\"\nE. [Advice to younger self] \"If I could talk to my 24-year-old self about AI…\"\n\n- A: Focus on 'things I wish I knew'—speaks to experience and reflection.\n- B: Listicle approach makes it snackable, practical.\n- C: Personal story, relatable to others.\n- D: Problem-focused = actionable for the reader.\n- E: Casual, almost conversational/advice vibe.\n\nStep 6: Choose strongest direction\nLet’s pick E: Advice to my younger self, since it’s approachable, personal, and transparent.\n\nStep 7: Final post",
  "final_post": "If I could talk to my 24-year-old self about AI, here’s what I’d say:\n\n\nAt 24, I was obsessed with chasing every flashy new AI tool. Five years later, these are the principles I wish I’d focused on from the start:\n\n- Don’t use AI just to use AI. Solve the *actual* problem—tech for its own sake creates unnecessary complexity.\n- Focus on the problem, not the technology. The best solutions are rooted in real needs, not hype.\n- Invest more time curating your data. Quality data upfront saves you pain later.\n- Data quality > data quantity. A clean, reliable dataset beats endless noisy ones every time.\n- Run experiments early and often. Fast feedback teaches faster than weeks of theory.\n\nWhat’s one lesson you wish you learned earlier in your AI journey?"
