  "writing_steps": "Step 1: \n- Purpose: Promote Shaw’s new (free) LLM course repo and build interest for the upcoming AI Builders Cohort, while providing value.\n- Audience: AI learners, technical creators, and potential cohort signups (followers interested in learning applied LLMs).\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n- Hook about the flood of LLM content—here’s a free, hands-on alternative\n- Details on what’s in the repo & why it exists (emphasis on practical learning)\n- Clear mention that a new cohort is coming for those who want accountability or community\n- CTA: Ask who’s planning to build an LLM project this summer?\n\nStep 3: Body \nTired of theory-heavy AI courses? I just published a free, open-source LLM course on GitHub—designed for builders, not just readers. \n\nInside, you’ll find:\n- Practical lessons (Colab notebooks, projects, and evals)\n- Zero-fluff—just the workflows you’ll actually use\n- Examples you can tweak for your own projects\n\nBuilt this after seeing too many people get stuck in AI “tutorial hell.” This repo is designed to help you start shipping—fast. \n\nIf you want more hands-on help, I’m also launching a new AI Builders Cohort soon. Think: accountability, live feedback, and a community of motivated devs.\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWho’s planning to build (and actually ship) an LLM project this summer?\n\nStep 5A: Hook Directions\n1. [Problem/solution]: “Most AI courses overwhelm or bore you—here’s a resource to help you build.”\n2. [Trend/urgency]: “LLMs are moving fast. You can’t afford to just ‘read’ anymore—time to build.”\n3. [Personal story]: “After years stuck in ‘tutorial hell,’ here’s what I wish I had when I started.” \n4. [Concrete offer]: “Just dropped my free, open-source LLM course (GitHub link).”\n\nStep 5B: Notes\n1. Overwhelm vs action, shifting to building\n2. Need for hands-on skills in today’s AI landscape\n3. Humble—relatable origin, serving readers’ pain\n4. Simple, direct, actionable\n\nStep 5C: Choose strongest: Tie between 1 and 3; combine - most people get stuck in AI course overwhelm, I created the thing I wish I had.\n\nFinal Hook:\nToo many AI learners get stuck in ‘tutorial hell.’\nSo I built the LLM course I wish I had—free and hands-on.\n\nStep 6: Review\nHook is above the fold, voice is accessible and honest, repo is central, shoutout for upcoming cohort, focused question to drive engagement.\n\nStep 7: Final Post within wireframe.",
  "final_post": "Too many AI learners get stuck in ‘tutorial hell.’\nSo I built the LLM course I wish I had—free and hands-on.\n\nI just dropped a free, open-source LLM course on GitHub—made for builders, not just readers.\n\nHere’s what you’ll find inside:\n• Colab notebooks you can run and remix\n• Real-world mini-projects (not just hello world)\n• Evals, prompts, and best practices I use daily\n\nI built this after seeing talented devs get lost in endless AI theory. I want you to actually ship useful LLMs—without the overwhelm.\n\nP.S. If you want deeper accountability and community, the next AI Builders Cohort is coming up soon. Can’t wait to share more.\n\nWho’s planning to build (and actually ship) an LLM project this summer?\n\n(GitHub link in comments)"
