Target audience: aspiring AI solopreneurs, developers new to agents, and his existing audience interested in hands-on action.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n- Hook: You’ll be able to build your first AI agent after reading this post\n- Meat: Lay out the exact blueprint and simplest way to get started\n- CTA: Call for readers to try it and share what they’ll build/ask follow-up questions\n\nStep 3: Meat\nBuilding an AI agent sounds intimidating. But if you break it down, it’s just three basic steps:\n\n1. ✅ Pick a simple tool (like LangChain, CrewAI, or OpenAI Assistants API)\n2. 🏗️ Define the task you want your agent to do (e.g., summarize documents, draft emails, answer FAQs)\n3. 🧩 Connect the dots: feed your tool a prompt, set up input/output, and hit ‘run’\n\nYou don’t need deep ML knowledge. Try building an agent that answers questions about a PDF or generates daily summaries from your calendar. Start tiny. Once it works, you’ll see how fast you can build real, useful workflows.\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhat’s the first task you’d automate with your own AI agent?\n\nStep 5A: Brainstorm hooks\n- [Promise/outcome] “Build your first AI agent today—no experience required”\n- [Problem/solution] “Think AI agents are scary? Here’s the 3-step beginner blueprint”\n- [Personal story] “My first AI agent was embarrassingly simple—and yours should be too”\n\nStep 5B: Short notes\n- [Promise] Emphasize literally building\n- [Problem] Highlight simplicity/‘anyone can do it’\n- [Personal] Make it relatable and encourage ‘start small’\n\nStep 5C: Pick best direction and write hook\nI’ll pick the [Promise/outcome]:\n\n\"By the end of this post, you’ll be able to build your first AI agent—even if you’ve never touched code before.\"\n\nStep 6: Review for Shaw's style: approachable, clear, actionable, friendly. White space and checkmarks for clarity.\n\nStep 7: Final post below.",

Don’t over-engineer—start with something tiny and real. (My first agent just sent me morning reminders!)\n\nThe first time it works, you’ll realize: you can automate real work. And it’s not magic—it’s just building blocks.\n\nWhat’s the first task you’d automate with your own AI agent?"
