  "input": "Share blog: Local LLM fine-tuning on Mac\n\nContext:\nThis article is part of a larger series on using large language models (LLMs) in practice. In a previous post, I showed how to fine-tune an LLM using a single (free) GPU on Google Colab. While that example (and many others) readily runs on Nvidia hardware, they are not easily adapted to M-series Macs. In this article, I walk through an easy way to fine-tune an LLM locally on a Mac.",
  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Share and promote a new blog post, educate technical practitioners interested in LLMs, especially those using Macs.\n- Audience: Fellow AI/ML practitioners, technical builders, solopreneurs, and educators who want to train LLMs locally and may not have easy access to Nvidia GPUs.\n\nStep 2: Post Wireframe\n[Hook]\n[Summary of the post's main insight and importance for Mac users]\n[Link to full blog]\n[Single CTA/question]\n\nStep 3: Body\nMost LLM fine-tuning guides assume you have Nvidia hardware—but what if you're working on an M-series Mac?\nI just published a step-by-step article showing how to fine-tune large language models *locally* on your Mac—no Colab, no remote GPU, just your machine.\n\nIn this guide, you'll get:\n• A walkthrough of the setup process for M1/M2/M3 Macs\n• The key libraries and config tweaks that make it possible\n• Tips for working with models efficiently on Apple Silicon\n\nIf you’ve wanted to experiment with LLMs but felt boxed out by hardware requirements, this one’s for you.\n\nStep 4: CTA/Question\nCurious—what’s the biggest roadblock you’ve hit running ML projects locally?\n\nStep 5: Hook Brainstorm\nA) [Problem/solution] “Most LLM tutorials break when you’re on a Mac. Here’s how to actually fine-tune LLMs locally.”\nB) [Personal story] “I couldn’t fine-tune LLMs on my Mac... until I found this setup.”\nC) [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “Think you need Nvidia GPUs to fine-tune LLMs? Not anymore.”\n\nStep 5B: Notes\nA) Calls out a practical frustration for Mac users who hit CUDA errors.\nB) Tells a quick pain-to-solution journey.\nC) Contrasts a common misconception with a new, accessible way.\n\nStep 5C: Pick C. It’s direct, myth-busting, and sets the stage for the value.\n\nStep 6: Review\nStyle: Clear, compact, technical mentor tone. Direct link to guide. Ends with engaging, experience-based question.\nSequence: Hook → what/why → key points → specific value → question\n\nStep 7: Final Post",
  "final_post": "Think you need Nvidia GPUs to fine-tune LLMs? Not anymore.\n\nMost tutorials for large language model fine-tuning break the moment you try them on a Mac. But there’s now a reliable way to run the *entire* process locally on M-series Macs—no Colab, no cloud GPUs, all on your own hardware.\n\nIn my latest post, I break down:\n• Step-by-step Mac setup (M1/M2/M3, no CUDA required)\n• The tweaks and libraries you *actually* need\n• Tips for making Apple Silicon work efficiently for LLMs\n\nIf you’ve felt boxed out of LLM fine-tuning because of your hardware, this guide is for you.\n\nRead the full how-to here: [blog link]\n\nWhat’s the biggest roadblock you’ve hit running ML projects locally?"
