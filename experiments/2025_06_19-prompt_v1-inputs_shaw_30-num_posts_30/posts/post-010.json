  "writing_steps": "Step 1:\n- Purpose: Inspire continuous learning and reframe the idea of wealth. Remind followers that mindset and knowledge are more valuable than just financial accumulation.\n- Target audience: Broad audience (students, entrepreneurs, anyone interested in self-development and AI).\n\nStep 2:\n- Hook possibilities:\n    - Challenge conventional thinking about money.\n    - Quote or distillation: 'Wealth isn't just your bank account.'\n    - Question: 'What makes you truly rich?'\n    - Share personal realization about learning over bank balance.\n- Post body: The meaning of being 'rich'—wealth as ongoing learning. Reflection on personal journey. Invitation to keep growing mentally (especially in AI/context of audience).\n- CTA: Direct, single: 'What’s one thing you’re learning right now?'\n\nStep 3:\nBody:\nMost people chase numbers in their accounts, but the real value is in how you think and what you know. When you focus on learning new skills, especially in fast-changing fields like AI, you unlock possibilities no balance sheet can measure. My biggest career shifts happened when I leaned into learning—not just chasing checks.\n\nStep 4:\nCTA: What’s one thing you’re learning right now?\n\nStep 5:\nStep 5A - Brainstorm hook directions:\n- [Problem/solution]: “Chasing money? Here’s what people miss about getting ‘rich’…”\n- [Personal story]: “The first time a deposit hit my bank, I realized it wasn’t the real win.”\n- [Quote]: “Being rich isn’t about your bank account—it’s about your mind.”\n- [Beginner-to-expert]: “Most people think wealth is money. I’ve found it’s actually focus.”\n- [Challenge]: “Most will spend years chasing wealth—and overlook where it starts.”\nStep 5B - Notes:\n- [Problem/solution]: Many are money-focused but miss mindset; learning is compound interest.\n- [Personal story]: Reframed after earning first big check.\n- [Quote]: Lead with distilled one-liner.\n- [Beginner-to-expert]: Controversial view; what gets you farther is your learning.\n- [Challenge]: Nudge to reset priorities.\nStep 5C - Choose Quote direction for maximum clarity and resonance. Write hook:\n“Being rich isn’t about your bank account—it’s about your mind.”\n\nStep 6: Review style, sequence, and voice:\n- Hook is plain and direct, actionable follow-through.\n- Body message clear, grounded—nods to Shaw’s AI educator journey, but applies broadly.\n- CTA clean and single, invites dialogue.\n\nStep 7: Write final post.",
  "final_post": "Being rich isn’t about your bank account—it’s about your mind.\n\nToo many people chase numbers, thinking wealth is about how much you’ve saved. The truth? The most valuable asset is how you think and what you know. \n\nWhen you invest in learning—especially in fields like AI where things move fast—you unlock opportunities no balance sheet can reflect. \n\nPersonally, my biggest leaps didn’t come from a bigger check, but from betting on myself to learn something new and stretch my mind.\n\nWhat’s one thing you’re learning right now?"
