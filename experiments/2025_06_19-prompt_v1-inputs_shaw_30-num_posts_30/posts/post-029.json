  "input": "Share blog: fine-tuning FLUX.1 on my face!\n\nContext:\nAlthough large language models (LLMs) seem to get all the attention these days, image-generation models have been advancing just as rapidly. The current state-of-the-art is FLUX.1, an image model from Black Forest Labs (a faction from the Stable Diffusion team). In this article, I share the full process I used for fine-tuning this model to generate unlimited high-quality photos of myself.",
  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Share useful content and promote a new AI tutorial/blog (fine-tuning FLUX.1 image model)\n- Audience: AI enthusiasts, technical peers, creators interested in generative AI and personal brand, folks following image models as well as LLMs\n\nStep 2: Post Wireframe\n[Engaging hook pulling in readers who may have missed image model progress]\n[Short summary of FLUX.1 and the unique project of fine-tuning it on my own face]\n[Clear CTA to read the detailed blog/tutorial]\n\nStep 3: Write the body/meat\nWhile LLMs seem to hog the spotlight, image models are rapidly evolving in the background. The latest player is FLUX.1, an open-source image generator built by Black Forest Labs—a spin-out from the Stable Diffusion team.\n\nI recently experimented with fine-tuning FLUX.1... using my own face.\n\nIn my new article, I walk you through the entire process—from dataset setup to the fine-tuning scripts, best practices I discovered, and examples of the (slightly uncanny) results.\n\nStep 4: Write CTA\nCurious how I did it? Check out the full process in my latest blog.\n\nStep 5A: Brainstorm hook directions\n1. [Trend/urgency] \"Everyone's obsessed with LLMs, but image models just got a major upgrade.\"\n2. [Personal story] \"What happened when I fine-tuned a state-of-the-art image model on my own face?\"\n3. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] \"Most people miss how quickly generative image models are advancing—here's proof.\"\n4. [Problem/solution] \"Want unlimited high-quality headshots? Here's how I created them with FLUX.1.\"\n5. [Results/outcomes] \"See what happened when I taught FLUX.1 to generate images of me.\"\n\nStep 5B: Add notes to each direction\n1. LLMs get all the attention, but image models like FLUX.1 just took a big leap.\n2. Personal anecdote—made my own AI-generated photos, lessons learned.\n3. Contrast LLM focus with image model progress.\n4. DIY headshots, expansion for creators/personal branding.\n5. Show off actual results as proof.\n\nStep 5C: Choose the strongest direction and write hook\nStrongest: #2 (Personal story—makes the experience approachable, personal)\nHook: \"What happens when you train an AI image model on your own face? I tried it with FLUX.1.\"\n\nStep 6: Review for style, sequence, voice\n- Personal, friendly, technical peer-to-peer\n- Clear focus on sharing the journey (not hyping the tool)\n- Calls out both the advance in image models and practical, honest experimentation\n- Invites readers to take a look, not a hard sell\n\nStep 7: Write the final post",
  "final_post": "What happens when you train an AI image model on your own face? I tried it with FLUX.1.\n\nWhile LLMs still dominate most AI conversations, image-generation models are quietly making massive leaps. FLUX.1—a new open-source image model from the minds behind Stable Diffusion—just arrived on the scene.\n\nSo I decided to put it to the test and fine-tuned FLUX.1 on my own photos, step by step. The result? I can now generate unlimited (slightly uncanny) “headshots” of myself in any setting I want.\n\nIn my new blog, I break down the entire process: prepping the dataset, running the fine-tuning scripts, lessons learned, and sample outputs.\n\nCurious how I did it? Check out the full process in my latest article."
