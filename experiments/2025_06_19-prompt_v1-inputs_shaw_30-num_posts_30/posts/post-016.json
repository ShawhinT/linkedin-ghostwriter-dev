  "writing_steps": "Step 1: \n- Purpose: Share educational content (blog post) and drive traffic to the blog. \n- Target audience: AI enthusiasts, developers, students interested in NLP and machine learning.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n[Engaging hook]\n[Summary of the blog and core lessons + personal angle]\n[CTA: Ask if people have fine-tuned a model]\n\nStep 3: Body\nFine-tuning BERT for text classification isn't just a research paper exercise. It's one of the most practical skills you can build if you want to work with real-world language data.\n\nIn my latest blog, I break down step-by-step:\n- How to structure your datasets\n- Which hyperparameters matter most\n- Common pitfalls I’ve run into (and how to avoid them)\n- The full code (open-sourced)\n\nWhether you're classifying support tickets, customer reviews, or news articles, this guide is for you.\n\nStep 4: CTA\nHave you tried fine-tuning a transformer model yet?\n\nStep 5A: Brainstorm Hook Directions\n1. [Problem/solution] “Transformer models feel overwhelming—but BERT can be your secret weapon for text classification tasks.”\n2. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “Most guides skip the hands-on steps—here’s how I actually fine-tune BERT for real projects.”\n3. [Personal story] “I used to think BERT was ‘for researchers’—until I used it to automate my inbox.”\n4. [Results/outcomes] “With just a few lines of code, I turned BERT into a text classification machine.”\n5. [Trend/urgency] “BERT skill = more opportunities in NLP. Here’s how to level up.”\n\nStep 5B: Short Notes\n1. Many avoid BERT thinking it’s complicated—show them where to start.\n2. Emphasize practical, hands-on clarity.\n3. Make it approachable: You don’t need to be a researcher.\n4. Concrete benefit – working model fast.\n5. Picking up these skills pays off immediately.\n\nStep 5C: Choose Direction/Write Hook\nLet’s go with [Beginner-to-expert clarity]:\n\n“Fine-tuning BERT sounds complex—but it’s actually simpler (and more useful) than most people think.”\n\nStep 6: Review\n- Style: Friendly, technical, direct, sharing lessons and code.\n- Voice: Honest, approachable, actionable.\n- CTA: Clear, single focus.\n\nStep 7: Final Post Below.\n",
  "final_post": "Fine-tuning BERT sounds complex—but it’s actually simpler (and more useful) than most people think.\n\nI just released a new blog breaking down how to fine-tune BERT for text classification—step by step, with code you can run.\n\nHere’s what I cover:\n- How to prep your dataset and avoid easy mistakes\n- The hyperparameters that really matter (and why)\n- What tripped me up when I started—and how I fixed it\n- Full working code, open-sourced for you to tweak\n\nIf you’re tackling anything from support tickets to sentiment analysis, this blog is designed to get you unstuck and building fast.\n\nHave you tried fine-tuning a transformer model yet?"
