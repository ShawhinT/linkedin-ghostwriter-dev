  "input": "30 AI Projects You Can Build This Weekend (Free Guide)\n\nCovers Software 1.0 (Analysis & Data Pipelines), Software 2.0 (ML), Software 3.0 (Prompt Engineering, RAG, AI Agents, Fine-tuning)",
  "writing_steps": "Step 1:\n- Purpose: Educate and validate interest in a downloadable free guide by sharing high-value content upfront. ‘Teaser’ post to drive curiosity and download intent.\n- Target Audience: Aspiring builders, developers, self-taught technologists, tech-side freelancers, anyone wanting practical AI project ideas (with a slight slant toward those newer to the space or looking for clear examples).\n\nStep 2 (Wireframe):\n1. [Engaging hook about actionable AI projects]\n2. [List/highlights breakdown of the types of projects and tiers: Software 1.0, 2.0, 3.0—convey clarity, progression, and the range]\n3. [Silent plug for the free guide, i.e., say ‘Download link in comments’ or ‘Drop a comment for the guide’]\n4. [Single CTA: Which project would you build first?]\n\nStep 3 (Body Meat):\nAI isn’t just for ‘coders’ anymore. There’s a DIY project for every skill level:\n\n- Software 1.0: Scrape your LinkedIn, clean up resumes, automate boring Excel tasks… (No ML background needed.)\n- Software 2.0: Level up with real ML—build basic image classifiers, sentiment analyzers, or automagic chatbots.\n- Software 3.0: Try prompt engineering, deploy Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) search, or build your first AI agent. Experiment with finetuning models on custom data.\n\nI put together a guide: 30 AI Projects You Can Build This Weekend. Actionable. Zero-fluff. All free tools.\n\nStep 4 (CTA):\nWhich project are you most excited to try?\n\nStep 5A (Hook directions):\n1. [Problem/solution] “Most AI guides are theory-heavy. Here’s 30 projects you can actually build this weekend.”\n2. [Numbers/Results] “30 step-by-step AI projects (broken down by skill level)—free download.”\n3. [Beginner-to-expert] “Software 1.0 → 3.0: See how AI building blocks evolve with 30 hands-on projects.”\n4. [Personal story] “I couldn’t find practical AI side projects—so I built a free guide with 30 you can copy.”\n5. [Trend/urgency] “AI moves fast. Don’t just read about it—build something this weekend.”\n\nStep 5B (Notes):\n1. ‘Theory-heavy’ = beginner-friendly hook\n2. Numbers draw attention, speaks to skimmers and those wanting volume\n3. Framing by ‘levels’ appeals to those on a learning journey, makes the guide look structured\n4. Personal angle gives authenticity, “built what I wish I had”\n5. Urgency: ‘Build something now’ counters the lurking/overwhelm effect\n\nStep 5C (Pick best direction for hook): [Numbers + levels]: “30 actionable AI projects (organized from Software 1.0 to 3.0)”\n\nStep 6 (Review for Shaw’s style):\n- Conversational, bullet points for scan-ability\n- Sets clear, realistic “you can do this” expectations\n- Honest, actionable (“all free tools”)\n- Invites a single, focused call to action\n\nStep 7 (Final Post):",
  "final_post": "30 actionable AI projects—from Software 1.0 to 3.0—(free guide)\n\nAI isn’t just theory (or reserved for big tech teams).\n\nThis weekend, you can build real projects—no matter your background:\n\n• Software 1.0: Scrape data from LinkedIn, auto-clean your resume, or automate Excel workflows (no ML required)\n• Software 2.0: Step up with ML—train a sentiment analyzer, basic image classifier, or auto-label text\n• Software 3.0: Go further—try prompt engineering, spin up a RAG search, fine-tune a model, or build your first AI agent\n\nI put together a no-fluff guide:\n➡️ 30 AI Projects You Can Build This Weekend (using free tools)\n\nWhich project are you most excited to try?"
