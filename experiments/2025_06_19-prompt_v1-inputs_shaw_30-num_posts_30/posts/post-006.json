  "writing_steps": "Step 1:\nPurpose: Share key lessons from Shaw's journey of growing from 0 to $70k to inspire and educate aspiring entrepreneurs and AI educators.\nTarget Audience: Fellow entrepreneurs, aspiring solopreneurs, those early in their AI/online education journey.\n\nStep 2: Post Wireframe\n[Hook]\n[Body: Key lessons, real numbers, honest reflections, structured for scannability.]\n[Focused CTA]\n\nStep 3: Write the body (“meat”)\n\nHitting $70k wasn’t fast—and it definitely wasn’t a straight line. Here are the biggest lessons I learned along the way:\n\n1. Start before you’re “ready.” I wasted months trying to perfect my first product. The truth: real feedback only comes from real users. Launch early, learn fast.\n\n2. Diversify your income streams. My first $1k came from freelance consulting. My next $10k from a mini-course. Don’t rely on just one way to monetize your skills early on.\n\n3. Build in public. Sharing what I was learning (successes & failures) attracted collaborators, partners, and my best clients—all because they could see the journey, not just the highlight reel.\n\n4. Prioritize relationships. Most of my biggest breaks happened thanks to connections—not cold emails. Help others first, and the opportunities follow.\n\n5. Iterate ruthlessly. Nothing I sold in year one exists anymore. Don’t get too attached to any single idea.
