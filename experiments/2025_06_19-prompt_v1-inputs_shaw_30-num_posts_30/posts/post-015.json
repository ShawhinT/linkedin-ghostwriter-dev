  "writing_steps": "Step 1:\n- Purpose: Educate newcomers (possibly aspiring engineers, solopreneurs, or career switchers) on how to practically learn AI from scratch, as if it were 2025.\n- Target audience: Beginners in AI, people who feel overwhelmed and don’t know where to start — likely some technical curiosity, but little-to-no hands-on experience.\n\nStep 2:\nWireframe:\n[Hook: Clear, relatable intro to overcoming the intimidation of learning AI and making the path feel achievable.]\n[Meat: Explain the 5-step approach: 1) Start with ChatGPT/tools, 2) Install Python, 3) Beginner automation, 4) Intermediate ML, 5) Advanced real-world project. Emphasize learning by doing and practical milestones.]\n[CTA: Invite audience to share where they are on this path.]\n\nStep 3:\nThe meat of the post:\n\nIf I had to start learning AI today, here’s exactly how I’d do it (with zero knowledge):\n\n1. Start with ChatGPT (or similar):\n   - Use it every day. Ask it questions, brainstorm ideas, automate your daily tasks. Think of it as your learning coach and research assistant.\n\n2. Install Python (locally or on the cloud):\n   - Basic coding unlocks a new layer of power. Take the time to set up Python, learn to run scripts, and get comfortable working outside of spreadsheets.\n\n3. Build an automation (beginner):\n   - Automate something small—like sorting your emails, scraping news, or bulk renaming files. This builds confidence and foundational skills in programming and tooling.\n\n4. Build a simple ML project (intermediate):\n   - Tackle a classic problem (like predicting house prices or classifying emails). Use open datasets. Don’t stress about fancy models—focus on understanding the workflow: data → model → predictions.\n\n5. Build a real-world project (advanced):\n   - Solve a problem you care about, using AI as part of the solution. It can be scrappy—as long as it’s useful and real. Example: Create an app that summarizes meeting notes, or an agent that reviews your code.\n\nBonus: At every step, share what you learn (on LinkedIn, X, or with friends). Teaching reinforces your knowledge and builds your network.\n\nStep 4:\nCTA: Where are you on this path?\n\nStep 5:\nStep 5A: Brainstorm hook directions:\n- [Problem/solution] \"Learning AI feels overwhelming—so here’s a simple roadmap.\"\n- [Personal story] “If I had to start over from zero in AI, here’s how I’d do it in 2025.”\n- [Trend/urgency] “AI is evolving fast. But the best way to learn in 2025 is surprisingly accessible.”\n- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “What most beginners get wrong about learning AI (and how to fix it)”\n\nStep 5B: Add notes:\n- [Problem/solution] Most people don’t know where to start; breaking it into clear milestones demystifies the process.\n- [Personal story] Position as if Shaw was a complete beginner, making the path relatable.\n- [Trend/urgency] Every new tool makes starting easier, but foundational steps remain the same.\n- [Clarity] Many chase courses and credentials—miss the power of building real things.\n\nStep 5C: Choose and write hook:\nChosen: [Personal story] “If I had to learn AI from scratch in 2025, here’s the exact path I’d take.”\n\nStep 6: Review: The post breaks the journey down into simple, actionable steps; tone is friendly and peer-oriented; ends with a single, focused question inviting engagement.\n\nStep 7: Write final post.",
  "final_post": "If I had to learn AI from scratch in 2025, here’s the exact path I’d take:\n\n1. Start with ChatGPT (or similar):\n   - Use it daily—as your coach, sounding board, and research partner. Experiment, ask basic questions, and automate day-to-day tasks.\n\n2. Install Python (locally or on the cloud):\n   - Get hands-on with the language that powers AI. Even basic scripting opens new doors beyond spreadsheets and no-code tools.\n\n3. Build an automation (beginner):\n   - Automate something simple—like sorting your inbox or scraping headlines. This builds confidence and gets you comfortable working with code and real data.\n\n4. Build a simple ML project (intermediate):\n   - Take on a classic (predicting house prices, classifying email). Use an open dataset and focus on the workflow: prepare data → train model → test predictions.\n\n5. Build a real-world project (advanced):\n   - Pick a problem you care about and solve it end-to-end using AI. Whether it’s a meeting summarizer or a personal code assistant, usefulness > polish.\n\nMy bonus tip: Share your journey as you go. Teaching—even if it’s just a LinkedIn post—fast-tracks your learning and connects you with others.\n\nWhere are you on this path?"
