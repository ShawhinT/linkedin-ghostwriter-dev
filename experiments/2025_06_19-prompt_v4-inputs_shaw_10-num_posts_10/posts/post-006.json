  "writing_steps": "Step 1: \n- Purpose: To share lessons learned from reaching $70k, likely in revenue or income, with educational takeaways for others on the path.\n- Target audience: Fellow entrepreneurs, solopreneurs, aspiring founders, and those building an audience or product online.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n[Engaging hook: Either a number-based or curiosity hook related to the $70k milestone]\n\n[The body: Short context of reaching $70k, what I thought it would take, what really drove results, 2–4 practical lessons with tangible actions for readers.]\n\n[CTA: Ask for one practical lesson readers would add to this list.]\n\nStep 3: Body (Meat)\n- Briefly mention the milestone and what it represents (without making up context—could be income from a project, product, or client work).\n- Lesson 1: Start before you feel ready (with reasoning and a short example)\n- Lesson 2: Focused experimentation > scattered effort (why picking one or two channels/projects matters)\n- Lesson 3: Real feedback from real users/customers is a lever\n- Lesson 4: Don’t get trapped in learning mode; shipping beats perfect planning\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhat practical lesson would you add to this list?\n\nStep 5A: Brainstorm Hook Directions\n1. [User’s phrasing] “My Journey from 0 to 70k (key lessons)”\n2. [Number/results focus] “What I learned earning my first $70k online.”\n3. [Process clarity] “I thought it would take massive launches… instead, these things actually moved the needle (literally!).”\n4. [Beginner-to-expert] “Building to $70k wasn’t what I expected as an entrepreneur.”\n5. [Failure/surprise] “The biggest surprise after earning $70k as a solopreneur.”\n\nStep 5B: Notes for Each Direction\n1. [User’s own] Direct, milestone-driven; might lack curiosity to click\n2. [Results] Focus on “learned” and “$70k” for authority plus curiosity\n3. [Process clarity] Bust a common myth vs. reality\n4. [Expectations] Call out what most beginners get wrong\n5. [Surprise] Share a shift in mindset after the experience\n\nStep 5C: Choosing the Best Hook\n#2 (“What I learned earning my first $70k online”) is clearest and most likely to interest Shaw’s audience; also fits established formats in example posts.\n\nStep 6: Draft\nWhat I learned earning my first $70k online\n\nGetting to $70k didn’t look like I expected.\n\nHere’s what actually helped me reach this milestone:\n\n1. Start before you feel ready\nThe perfect plan or product doesn’t exist. I made progress by shipping small projects and learning fast.\n\n2. Focus on a single channel\nTrying to do everything at once slowed me down. Committing to one main platform (newsletter, YouTube, or client work) helped me gain momentum.\n\n3. Feedback beats theory\nReal feedback from real users or customers gave me the clarity I needed. The best improvements came from listening to people using my work—not overanalyzing in isolation.\n\n4. Consistency > big launches\nSmall, steady progress almost always outperforms waiting for “the perfect” launch day.\n\nWhat practical lesson would you add to this list?\n\nStep 7: Review\n- No business clichés or motivational language\n- Literal, direct, practical\n- Uses stepwise breakdown and ends on a single CTA\n- Style matches example posts (clear, concise, actionable)\n- Em dash audit: Only one em dash at most\n- No repeated phrases in hook/first lines\n- CTA focused and factual\n\nStep 8: Final Post",

Start before you feel ready\nMaking progress meant shipping small projects and learning as I went—not waiting for a perfect plan.\n\n2. Focus on one channel\nJuggling every platform slowed me down. Picking a main project, like my newsletter or client work, helped me build momentum.\n\n3. Get real feedback\nThe best improvements came from actual users or customers. Listening to their input was more valuable than overanalyzing alone.\n\n4. Consistency, not launches\nSmall, regular progress worked better than trying to make a big splash all at once.\n\nWhat practical lesson would you add to this list?"
