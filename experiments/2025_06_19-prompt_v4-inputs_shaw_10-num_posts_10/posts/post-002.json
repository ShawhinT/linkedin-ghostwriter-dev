  "writing_steps": "**Step 1: Purpose & Audience**\n- Purpose: Educate (share practical principles for using AI effectively), validate content idea (reflecting on lessons learned)\n- Audience: Early-career AI engineers, data scientists, or anyone interested in practical AI development\n\n**Step 2: Wireframe**\n[Engaging 1-2 line hook (above the fold)]\n\n[Short list of the 5 principles, each with a short explanation or framing]\n\n[CTA: Ask for specific additions or what others wish they knew]\n\n**Step 3: Write the Body**\n\nAt 29, here are the foundational AI principles I wish I had internalized at 24:\n\n1. Don't use AI (unless you actually need it): It’s tempting to add machine learning to every project, but often a simpler solution works better—and is easier to maintain.\n2. Focus on problems, not tech: Start with a real user or business problem. Only pick tools once you understand what you’re actually trying to solve.\n3. Spend more time on data curation: Clean, well-labeled data is often more valuable than fancy models. Invest in the part everyone skips.\n4. Data quality > data quantity: 100 solid examples teach your model more than 10,000 messy ones.\n5. Run experiments: Don’t assume—test. Run small, targeted experiments and let real results guide your choices.\n\n**Step 4: CTA**\nWhat other AI principles do you wish you’d learned earlier?\n\n**Step 5A: Brainstorm Hook Directions**\n1. [User's phrasing] \"AI principles I know at 29, I wish I had known at 24.\"\n- Calls out hindsight and practical learning\n2. [Problem/solution] Many new practitioners focus on tech and overlook the basics that truly move AI projects forward.\n3. [Results/outcomes] 5 lessons that would have saved me years of frustration in AI.\n4. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] Most people start with algorithms—here’s why you should start elsewhere.\n\n**Step 5B: Add Notes**\n1. [User] Clear, direct statement about age and lessons—a personal touch.\n2. [Problem/solution] Highlighting tech-first approach being overrated vs problem-first and data-first.\n3. [Results] Frustration/time saved by following these 5 principles.\n4. [Beginner-to-expert] Calling out common misconception, putting data and experiments above flashy models.\n\n**Step 5C: Choose Strongest Direction and Write Hook**\n- The user's phrasing is short and grounded, works well: \"AI principles I know at 29, I wish I had known at 24\"\n\n**Step 6: Full Draft**\n\nAI principles I know at 29, I wish I had known at 24.\n\nIf you’re getting started in AI, here are 5 principles that would have saved me a lot of time:\n\n1. Don't use AI unless you actually need it. Simple solutions usually win.\n2. Focus on problems, not tech. The right technology only matters once you understand the problem.\n3. Spend more time on data curation. Cleaning and labeling data drives better results than model tuning.\n4. Data quality > data quantity. A small set of high-quality examples beats a massive but noisy dataset every time.\n5. Run experiments. Don’t guess—test and learn from real outcomes.\n\nWhat other AI principles do you wish you’d learned earlier?\n\n**Step 7: Review for Style, Voice, Flow**\n- The post is literal, grounded, direct, and educational. There is no motivational summary or reflection. Clear bullet points. No business clichés or idioms. Only one em dash, used for clarity. The CTA is practical. Style matches the samples.\n\n**Step 8: Final Post**\n\n",

Spend more time on data curation. Clean, labeled data gets better results than endlessly tweaking models.\n4. Data quality > data quantity. A handful of good examples beats a huge, messy dataset.\n5. Run experiments. Don’t guess—test and see what works.\n\nWhat other AI principles do you wish you’d learned earlier?"
