  "writing_steps": "**Step 1: Purpose and Audience**\n- Purpose: Educate—provide a practical, actionable post for readers to build their first AI agent.\n- Audience: Developers, AI enthusiasts, potential students interested in hands-on AI projects.\n\n**Step 2: Wireframe**\n[Hook]\n[Stepwise breakdown of how to build a basic AI agent, at a practical beginner level]\n[CTA: Ask what project readers want to start with or what step they’d like to see broken down in more detail]\n\n**Step 3: Body (“Meat”):**\nHere’s a quick roadmap to go from zero to your first working AI agent:\n\n1. Pick a simple use case (e.g. email summarizer, calendar assistant).\n2. Choose your stack (most people start with Python + LangChain or OpenAI functions API).\n3. Define what your agent should do: the main input, desired output, and any required tools or APIs.\n4. Start simple: chain together a few prompts to handle the basic flow (e.g. receive a prompt, fetch info, return answer).\n5. Add API integrations (e.g. Google Calendar for scheduling, Gmail API for reading emails).\n6. Test with real inputs—fix what breaks.\n7. Optional: Add a basic UI (Streamlit is easy for Python projects).\n\nMost people get stuck trying to over-engineer v1. Just get a rough demo working! Iterate from there.\n\n**Step 4: CTA/Question:**\nWhich AI agent project would you want to build first?\n\n**Step 5: Hook Brainstorming**\n\n- [User’s own phrasing]: \"By the end of this post you’ll be able to build your first AI agent\"\n- [Problem/solution]: \"Most people never ship an AI agent because they overcomplicate v1. Here’s how to get a working prototype—fast.\"\n- [Beginner-friendly]: \"Building your first AI agent is much easier than it looks.\"\n- [Step-by-step clarity]: \"7 steps to build your first AI agent without getting stuck in research mode.\"\n- [Personal observation]: \"The biggest blocker I see for new agent builders? They try to do too much in v1.\"\n\n**Notes:**\n- User’s phrasing is straightforward but a little outcome-based—OK for the target audience.\n- The problem/solution angle is more engaging and grounded in common reader obstacles.\n\n**Step 6: Full Draft (using strongest hook—problem/solution angle, but drawing from user’s directness)**\n\nMost people never ship their first AI agent because they overcomplicate version 1.\n\nHere’s a simple, proven path to go from zero to a working agent:\n\n1. Pick a real use case (keep it small: e.g. summarize emails, schedule events).\n2. Choose your stack: Python + LangChain or OpenAI’s API makes it easy.\n3. Define clear inputs and outputs.\n4. Chain your prompts together for the main workflow (start ugly!).\n5. Add 1–2 API integrations (Gmail, Google Calendar, etc.).\n6. Test with real inputs—fix what breaks.\n7. If you want a UI, try Streamlit for a fast web demo.\n\nDon’t worry about being fancy out the gate. Ship a rough draft—refinements come later.\n\nWhich AI agent project would you want to build first?\n\n**Step 7: Style, Voice, and Flow Review**\n- Factual, practical, grounded—matches Shaw’s style.\n- Stepwise process, clear and specific.\n- CTA is a single question, factual, grounded in what the post is teaching.\n- No motivational reflection or business clichés.\n\n**Step 8: Final Post**\n(see below)",
  "final_post": "Most people never ship their first AI agent because they overcomplicate version 1.\n\nHere’s a straightforward path to go from zero to a working agent:\n\n1. Pick a use case that solves a small, real problem (like summarizing emails or scheduling events).\n2. Choose your stack: Python + LangChain or the OpenAI API are good places to start.\n3. Define exactly what the agent takes as input and what it should output.\n4. Chain a couple prompts together to handle the basic workflow (start simple).\n5. Integrate with 1–2 APIs if your agent needs data or actions from external sources (like Gmail or Calendar).\n6. Test with real inputs and fix what breaks—this is where you learn fast.\n7. If you want a UI, Streamlit can help you put together a quick web demo.\n\nDon’t wait for perfect—just get a basic demo working and iterate from there.\n\nWhich AI agent project do you want to build first?"
