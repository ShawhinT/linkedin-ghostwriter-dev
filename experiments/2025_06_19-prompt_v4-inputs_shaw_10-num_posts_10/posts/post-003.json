  "writing_steps": "Step 1: \nPurpose: Educate and motivate potential or aspiring AI engineers by breaking down what top AI engineers do differently (with a practical, actionable focus). \nTarget Audience: Aspiring and mid-level AI engineers, technical students, and early-stage practitioners who may feel intimidated by perceived “genius” in the AI field.\n\nStep 2: Post Wireframe \n[Hook]: Most top AI engineers aren’t more intelligent than you. They just do this one thing more… BUILD\n[Meat]: Observation about “building” being the practical differentiator, not intelligence; break down what “building” actually means, with 3-4 specific behaviors or projects (e.g., shipping prototypes, learning by doing, failing and iterating); connect to how most people get stuck in “tutorial hell” or imposter syndrome instead of hands-on project work. \n[CTA]: What’s the smallest project you’ve shipped recently?\n\nStep 3: Body/Meat\n\nThe difference isn’t IQ or how many research papers you’ve read—it’s the volume of practical projects completed, especially ones shared with others or used by real users.\n\nWhen you focus on building:\n- You get fast feedback on what works (and what doesn’t)\n- You develop practical intuition for picking the right tools/approaches\n- You make mistakes faster—and actually learn from them\n\nMost people spend too long watching tutorials or reading docs. But the engineers making real progress are the ones who learn by building (even if it’s messy or incomplete).\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhat’s the smallest project you’ve shipped recently?\n\nStep 5: Hook Brainstorm\nA. [User’s own phrasing] “Most top AI engineers aren’t more intelligent than you...”\nB. [Problem/solution] “Stuck in tutorial hell? Here’s how to break out—and actually become a better engineer.”\nC. [Results/outcomes] “Built 10+ projects this month? That’s the difference-maker for top AI engineers.”\nD. [Beginner-to-expert clarity] “The best AI engineers aren’t the smartest—they just learn by building.”\nE. [Personal observation] “I’ve seen more growth building scrappy prototypes than chasing perfect tutorials.”\n\nShort notes:\nA. Uses user’s language, relatable\nB. Addresses “tutorial hell” (common problem)\nC. Quantity/frequency of shipped projects\nD. Dispels myth, reframes the path\nE. Personal, humble, mentor-like\n\nPick A: Direct, punchy, aligns well with user input and Shaw’s style\n\nStep 6: Full Post Draft\n\nMost top AI engineers aren’t more intelligent than you.\nThey just do this one thing more: they build.\n\nThe difference isn’t IQ or how many research papers you’ve read—it’s how many messy, small projects you actually finish (and maybe ship to users).\n\nWhen you focus on building, you:\n- Get fast feedback on what works\n- Learn which tools matter from experience—not theory\n- Make more mistakes and actually remember the lesson\n\nIt’s tempting to think more reading or tutorials will get you there. But the real shortcut? Shipping projects, even if they’re basic or unfinished.\n\nWhat’s the smallest project you’ve shipped recently?\n\nStep 7: Review for Style, Voice, and Flow\n- Only one em dash, replaced with colon where appropriate.\n- Clear, practical, no motivational punchlines or reflection-based CTA.\n- Direct, approachable language.\n- Includes a practical, educational insight (shipping projects beats theory).\n\nStep 8: Final Post\n",
  "final_post": "Most top AI engineers aren’t more intelligent than you.\nThey just do this one thing more: they build.\n\nIt isn’t about IQ or reading every research paper. The real difference is how many projects you finish—especially if you get them in front of real users.\n\nWhat happens when you focus on building?\n- You get fast feedback (instead of guessing what works)\n- You build practical intuition for tools and approaches\n- You make—and remember—real mistakes\n\nMost people get stuck reading or watching instead of doing. But the engineers making progress are the ones learning by building, even if their projects are small or incomplete.\n\nWhat’s the smallest project you’ve shipped recently?"
