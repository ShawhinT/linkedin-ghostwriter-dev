  "writing_steps": "Step 1:\n- Purpose: To encourage continuous learning and shift focus from external wealth to knowledge accumulation. \n- Target audience: Aspiring entrepreneurs, learners, and professionals interested in personal growth.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n- Hook: Reframe what it means to be “rich” (focus: knowledge, not just money)\n- Body: \n    - Common misconception: thinking wealth is just financial\n    - Personal observation: Real lever is mental skillset\n    - Practical insight: How developing technical skills, especially with AI, opens real opportunities\n    - Encourage: Stay curious, keep updating your toolkit\n- CTA: What skills are you learning right now that you think will pay off in the next year?\n\nStep 3: Body\nA lot of the conversation around success focuses on income, salary, or what’s in your account. But in my experience, the real difference-maker is never just capital—it’s skillset. \n\nInvesting in technical skills (coding, AI, business fundamentals) consistently leads to new, real opportunities. The main asset you have is your ability to learn, adapt, and build new projects as tech evolves. That’s why I keep a habit of learning every week. \n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhat skills are you learning right now that you think will pay off in the next year?\n\nStep 5A: Hook Direction Brainstorm\n- [Problem/solution] So much advice is about money—but knowledge is the better investment\n- [Personal observation] The richest people I know aren’t always the ones with the biggest accounts, but the widest skillsets\n- [User’s phrasing] Being rich isn’t about your bank account—but what’s in your mind\n- [Practical] Technical skills compound over time and open new doors\n\nStep 5B: Notes\n- [Problem/solution] Most people focus on saving/investing, but technical upskilling actually drives growth\n- [Personal observation] This mirrors the path of most tech entrepreneurs\n- [User’s phrasing] Leverage “being rich is in your mind” language up top\n- [Practical] Give examples of skills: coding, AI, business\n\nStep 5C: Pick strongest: User’s phrasing—simple, direct, and fits Shaw’s literal, practical tone. Move “keep learning” into body/CTA.\n\nStep 6: Draft Full Post\nReminder: Being rich isn’t about what’s in your bank account, but what’s in your mind.\n\nFocusing only on financial wealth is the biggest distraction I see in the entrepreneurial space. The actual lever is your skillset—your ability to learn, adapt, and solve new problems as markets shift.\n\nIn practice, picking up one new technical skill (like coding or AI fundamentals) has opened more doors for me than any investment account ever could.\n\nThat’s why I treat learning as the main thing I “deposit” into each week.\n\nWhat skills are you learning right now that you think will pay off in the next year?\n\nStep 7: Style/Voice Review\n- Tone matches Shaw: clear, literal, educational, focusing on technical skillset, not fluff\n- Body is practical and focused on knowledge as true asset, not a generic motivation\n- Factual CTA: specific, not open-ended reflection\n- No business clichés, idioms, or figurative language\n- No repeated phrases, motivational tricolons, or inspirational language\n- Format uses white space\n\nStep 8: Final Post\n",
  "final_post": "Reminder: being rich isn’t about what’s in your bank account, but what’s in your mind.\n\nIn my experience, focusing on financial wealth alone is not the way forward. Your skillset—the ability to learn and adapt as tech evolves—is the lever that creates real opportunities.\n\nEvery technical skill you pick up (coding, AI, business fundamentals) is a deposit that compounds over time. That’s why I treat learning as my primary investment each week.\n\nWhat skills are you learning right now that you think will pay off in the next year?"
