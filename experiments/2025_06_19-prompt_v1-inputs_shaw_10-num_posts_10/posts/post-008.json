  "writing_steps": "Step 1: Purpose & Audience\n- Purpose: Celebrate a milestone, express gratitude, increase engagement, reinforce credibility as an AI educator.\n- Target audience: Subscribers, aspiring educators, fellow entrepreneurs, Shaw’s broader LinkedIn network—especially those interested in content creation, AI, and entrepreneurship.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n- Hook: Tease a significant milestone and tie it to the journey, not the number.\n- Meat: Share honest reflection on reaching 50k subscribers, what actually mattered vs. what didn’t, maybe a surprising lesson or challenge, gratitude, and personal note. A quick tip/lesson for those thinking of starting (or scaling) on YouTube.\n- CTA: Single, focused question—invite others to share their own creative milestones/journeys or ask for their top lesson from building in public.\n\nStep 3: Meat\nWhen I started my YouTube channel, I had zero idea whether anyone would care about what I had to say about AI and entrepreneurship. \n\nFast forward to today: we just crossed 50,000 subscribers.\n\nIt isn’t the number itself that matters to me—it’s the real conversations, late-night DMs, and seeing people use what I teach to build their own projects or businesses. \n\nWhat no one tells you: The 49,950 times you face creator’s block, don’t know what to post, or wonder if you’re making any impact. But the handful of real \"thank you\" messages or success stories? They’re gold. \n\nIf you’re building online (whether it’s YouTube, LinkedIn, or your own course):\n- Start before you’re comfortable\n- Share what you’re learning in public\n- Don’t chase viral—chase genuine impact\n\nTo everyone who’s watched, commented, or reached out—thank you. You’re why I keep going.\n\nStep 4: CTA\nWhat’s one lesson you’ve learned from sharing your journey online?\n\nStep 5: Hook\nStep 5A: Brainstorm directions\n- [Personal story] I never thought anyone would care about my videos on AI…\n- [Problem/solution] Most creators focus on the numbers—I’ve learned it’s about something different.\n- [Results/outcomes] 50,000 YouTube subscribers: what actually surprised me.\n- [Trend/urgency] More people are building in public—here’s what the journey to 50k taught me.\n- [Beginner-to-expert] Everyone starts at zero—here’s what I wish I’d known before hitting 50k.\nStep 5B: Short notes\n- [Personal story] “I doubted my voice, but real conversations kept me going.”\n- [Problem/solution] “The real value is in the DMs, not the view count.”\n- [Outcomes] “50,000 subs feels incredible (but not for the reasons I expected).”\nStep 5C: Pick strongest direction and write hook:\n“50,000 YouTube subscribers—what actually matters (it's not the number).”\n\nStep 6: Review for style and voice\n- Direct, humble, honest\n- Mix of personal story, practical lesson\n- Clear CTA, no jargon\n\nStep 7: Final Post below.",
