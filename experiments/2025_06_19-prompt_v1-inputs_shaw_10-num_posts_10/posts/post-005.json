  "writing_steps": "Step 1:\n- Purpose: Educate and empower readers to build their first AI agent (content validation, lead-in to technical education/offering).\n- Target audience: Beginners and aspiring solopreneurs interested in AI, people curious but overwhelmed by how to start with AI agents.\n\nStep 2: Wireframe\n- Hook: Promise a tangible, beginner-friendly outcome\n- Meat: Briefly explain what an AI agent is, debunk any complexity myths, outline a simple step-by-step to create a basic AI agent (could mention no-code/low-code tools or simple frameworks), encourage experimentation.\n- CTA: Ask readers if they want a detailed walkthrough or tool/code breakdown.\n\nStep 3: Body/Meat\nAI agents sound intimidating, but at their core, they’re just systems that use input, reasoning, and action to solve specific problems for you. The best part is: you don’t need to be a ML PhD to build one today. You need:\n\n1. A clear task (like answering emails, searching docs, or summarizing articles)\n2. An AI model (open-source or API—think GPT or Claude)\n3. A way to connect input → model → output (Zapier, Make, even a Google Sheet script)\n\nMy first agent? It organized my weekly reading notes. It took about 30 minutes—zero fancy code. The unlock: Start simple, get one working, then upgrade.\n\nStep 4: CTA/Question\nWhat task would you automate first with your own AI agent?\n\nStep 5: Hook Brainstorm\nA. [Outcome promise] \"By the end of this post, you’ll be able to build your first AI agent.\"\nB. [Problem/solution] \"AI agents look complicated—but you can build your first today, no PhD required.\"\nC. [Beginner intimidation] \"I wasted months overthinking AI agents. Here's how you can skip straight to building.\"\nD. [Quick win] \"You can launch an AI agent in under an hour—here’s how.\"\nE. [Story] \"My first AI agent wasn't pretty, but it worked (and it changed how I work).\"\n\nNotes for each:\nA. Most direct, strong clarity/promise\nB. Addresses reader intimidation, positions as mythbuster\nC. Personal failure angle, relatable\nD. Urgency and quick win angle\nE. Relatable, personal story, hints at the process\n\nI pick Direction B because it tackles the reader's main fear (complexity) and builds trust. \n\nFinal Hook:\nAI agents sound complicated (they're not). You can build your first today—no ML degree needed.\n\nStep 6: Review\n- Hook is direct and reframes intimidation\n- Body is concise, actionable, demystifies the process\n- CTA is specific and focused on reader engagement\n- Voice: Friendly, practical, mentor-like\n\nStep 7: Write the final post",
  "final_post": "AI agents sound complicated (they're not). You can build your first today—no ML degree needed.\n\nAt their core, AI agents are just tools that take an input, reason through it, and take action to solve a problem for you. Here’s the best news: you don’t have to be a machine learning expert to get started.\n\nHere’s the simplest way to build your first agent:\n\n1. Pick a clear, small task (like summarizing articles, answering emails, or organizing your calendar)\n2. Choose an AI model (an API like GPT, Claude, or even an open-source option)\n3. Connect your input to the model—and the output—to wherever you want with tools like Zapier, Make, or even Google Scripts\n\nMy first agent auto-sorted my weekly reading notes for me. It took less than 30 minutes and zero fancy code—in fact, the secret is starting simple and learning as you go.\n\nWhat task would you automate first with your own AI agent?"
