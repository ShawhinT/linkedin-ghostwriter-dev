  "writing_steps": "Step 1:\n- Purpose: Educate and share lessons learned to help others avoid common pitfalls in early AI journeys—position Shaw as a mentor and peer with experience.\n- Target Audience: Early-career AI practitioners, students, junior engineers, or anyone breaking into AI (especially those overwhelmed by tools & hype).\n\nStep 2: Post Wireframe\n- Hook: Personal/reflective insight about \"What I wish I knew\"—a nod to growing experience.\n- Meat: List and briefly explain 5 principles.\n- CTA: Invite readers to add what they wish they knew earlier.\n\nStep 3: Write Body\n\nAfter 5 years in AI, these 5 principles would’ve saved me hours of confusion (and frustration):\n\n1. Don’t use AI (unless you truly need it). Too many problems are over-engineered with models—start simple, then automate.\n2. Focus on problems, not the tech. Pick a real pain point, then choose your tools. Not the other way around.\n3. Spend more time curating your data. Clean, consistent data is worth more than the fanciest algorithm.\n4. Data quality > data quantity. A tiny, accurate dataset beats massive, messy ones every time.\n5. Run experiments. Theories are nice, but shipping small tests teaches you more, faster.\n\nStep 4: CTA/Question\nWhat’s one thing you wish you knew earlier in your journey?\n\nStep 5: Brainstorm Hook Directions\nA. [Problem/solution] – Most struggle in AI due to tool-overload. \"What I wish I’d focused on instead.\"\nB. [Personal story] – “AI principles I know at 29, wish I had known at 24.”\nC. [Clarity] – “Stop wasting time on the latest AI tool—these 5 lessons are more important.\"\nD. [Vulnerability] – “I messed up in my early AI career. Here’s what I’d tell my younger self.\"\nE. [List/Numbers] – “5 AI principles I’d tattoo on my younger self’s arm if I could.”\n\nStep 5B: Add Notes\nA. [Problem/solution]: Starting in AI? Drowning in tools? Here’s what matters instead.\nB. [Personal story]: My journey from naive 24-year-old to slightly wiser 29-year-old.\nC. [Clarity]: The 5 lessons that top every tool or framework you’ve heard of.\nD. [Vulnerability]: The “ouch” moments that made these lessons stick for me.\nE. [List/Numbers]: 5 things—simple, practical, honest.\n\nStep 5C: Pick the strongest. \"Personal story\" is most relatable, fits Shaw’s honest/mentor vibe. Let’s frame it as reflection.\n\nFinal Hook: \"AI principles I know at 29, I wish I had known at 24.\" (almost the user’s raw, but works as a strong personal opener)\n\nStep 6: Review for Style, Sequence, Voice\n- Personal, grounded, actionable.\n- Bulleted list is clear and scannable.\n- Hook is personal, reflective.\n- CTA is a single, focused question inviting engagement.\n\nStep 7: Write Final Post.",
  "final_post": "AI principles I know at 29, I wish I had known at 24.\n\nAfter 5 years working in AI, these principles would’ve saved me a ton of confusion—and probably quite a few headaches:\n\n1. Don’t use AI (unless you really need it). Most problems are better solved with simpler tools first. Don’t rush to automation.\n2. Focus on problems, not tech. Start with a real pain point, then pick the solution—not the other way around.\n3. Spend more time on data curation. Clean, consistent data will outperform the fanciest model.\n4. Data quality > data quantity. I’d take a tiny, high-quality dataset over a massive, messy one any day.\n5. Run experiments. Theory is good, but nothing beats learning from small, real tests.\n\nWhat’s one thing you wish you knew earlier in your journey?"
