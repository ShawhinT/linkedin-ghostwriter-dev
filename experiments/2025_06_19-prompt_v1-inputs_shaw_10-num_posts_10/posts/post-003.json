  "writing_steps": "Step 1: \n- Purpose: Encourage aspiring AI builders that the gap separating them from top engineers is mostly about practice/building, not innate intelligence. \n- Audience: Aspiring AI engineers, early-career technologists, folks looking to break in or level up.\n\nStep 2:\nWireframe:\n- Hook: Challenge the myth that top AI engineers are “just smarter.”\n- Meat: Discuss the importance of building and experimenting, not over-indexing on theory or credentials. Mention how actually shipping projects leads to exponential skill growth.\n- CTA: Invite readers to reflect on what they could ship this week.\n\nStep 3:\nBody:\nI’ve worked alongside brilliant AI engineers. The common thread? It wasn’t IQ, a fancy degree, or even perfect leetcode scores—it was a relentless bias toward building real things. \n\nEvery new project is a lesson you can’t get from just reading papers. Shipping even a tiny tool, agent, or product teaches you more than months of passive learning. Every bug, every awkward user flow, every unexpected result? That’s progress in disguise.\n\nTop engineers aren’t “born ahead.” They just build—and ship—more often.\n\nStep 4:\nCTA:\nWhat would you build this week if you focused on progress over perfection?\n\nStep 5:\nBrainstorm Hook Directions:\n- [Problem/solution] Most people think top AI engineers are “just smarter”—here’s the actual difference\n- [Results/outcomes] Why the best AI folks level up *faster* than everyone else\n- [Beginner-to-expert clarity] The #1 thing most aspiring AI engineers overlook\n- [Personal story] A lesson from working alongside “top” AI folks\n\nNotes:\n- Problem/solution: Many feel they can’t catch up—looks like talent, but it’s consistency and building\n- Results/outcomes: Shipping = learning; action beats credentials\n- Beginner-to-expert: Most forget to *actually build*\n- Personal: “I saw first-hand how much more they shipped”\n\nPick strongest: Problem/solution with “myth bust” tone.\n\nFinal hook: Most top AI engineers aren’t more intelligent—the real gap is how much (and how often) they build.\n\nStep 6:\nReview: Flows well, meets Shaw’s voice (friendly, actionable, myth-busting). Clear CTA. Direct, honest.\n\nStep 7:\nWrite final post.",
